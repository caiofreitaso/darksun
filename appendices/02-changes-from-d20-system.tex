\section{Base Classes}
In general, warriors and thieves have gotten a boost via either bonus feats or new class features. Some class features were rearranged so that their progression is well behaved until the 30th level. The goal of these changes was to make the power gap between spellcasters and psionicists and these classes more manageable.

One change made on all base classes: Swim is not a class skill for any class (except water clerics).

There are two new classes: \textbf{Gladiator} and \textbf{Templar}.
