\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex):} To use this ability, a crodlu must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.

\textbf{Pounce (Ex):} If a crodlu charges, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.

\textbf{Rake (Ex):} Attack bonus +6 melee, damage 1d6+2.

\textbf{Skills:} Crodlu receive a +10 racial bonus on \skill{Jump} checks and a $-4$ penalty on \skill{Spot} checks.
