\MonsterStatsDescription{
    A dire bat has a wingspan of 4.5 meters and weighs about 100 kilograms.
}

Dire bats swoop down upon unsuspecting prey from above.

\textbf{Blindsense (Ex):} A dire bat uses echolocation to pinpoint creatures within 12 meters. Opponents still have total concealment against the bat unless it can actually see them.

\textbf{Skills:} Dire bats have a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsense is negated.
