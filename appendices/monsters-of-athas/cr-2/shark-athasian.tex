\textbf{Blindsense (Ex):} A shark can locate creatures underwater within a 9-meter radius. This ability works only when the shark is underwater.

\textbf{Keen Scent (Ex):} A shark can notice creatures by scent in a 54-meter radius and detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a kilometer.

\textbf{Skills:} A shark has a +8 racial bonus on any \skill{Swim} check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a \skill{Swim} check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
