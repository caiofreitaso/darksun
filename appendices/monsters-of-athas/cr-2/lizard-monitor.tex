\textbf{Skills:} A monitor lizard has a +8 racial bonus on any \skill{Swim} check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a \skill{Swim} check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. Monitor lizards have a +4 racial bonus on \skill{Hide} and \skill{Move Silently} checks. *In forested or overgrown areas, the \skill{Hide} bonus improves to +8.
