\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex):} If a jhakar hits with its bite it may initiate a grapple check as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. *A jhakar has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.

\textbf{Pulldown (Ex):} Once per round, a jhakar can either make a trip attack as a free action or aid another jhakar in a trip attack as a free action (but not both). If it wins the Strength check ($-2$ check modifier*), it may immediately make a melee attack against the tripped opponent. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the jhakar.

* A jhakar has a +4 racial bonus on Strength checks made to trip an opponent.

\textbf{Skills:} Jhakars receive a +4 racial bonus to Survival checks when tracking by scent.
