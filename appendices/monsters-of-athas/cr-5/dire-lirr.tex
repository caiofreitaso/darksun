\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex):} To use this ability, a lirr must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.

\textbf{Rake (Ex):} Attack bonus +14 melee, damage 1d6+3.

\textbf{Stun (Ex):} As a standard action, a lirr can emit a powerful roar capable of stunning creatures within a 12-meter cone. Creatures in the cone must make a Fortitude save (DC 17) or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\textbf{Skills:} The lirr has a +4 racial bonus to \skill{Jump} checks.
