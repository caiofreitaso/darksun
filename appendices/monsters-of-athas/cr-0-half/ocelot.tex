Ocelots rarely attack animals much bigger than themselves. When hunting, they stay hidden for 30 to 60 minutes waiting for their prey.

\textbf{Skills:} Ocelots receive a +4 racial bonus to \skill{Balance}, \skill{Hide}, and \skill{Move Silently} checks. *In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the \skill{Hide} bonus rises to +8.

Ocelots use their Dexterity modifier for \skill{Climb} checks.
