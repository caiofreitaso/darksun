A snake can always choose to take 10 on a \skill{Climb} check, even if rushed or threatened.

Snakes use either their Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for \skill{Climb} checks, whichever is higher.

A snake has a +8 racial bonus on any \skill{Swim} check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a \skill{Swim} check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
