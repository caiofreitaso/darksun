\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex):} To use this ability, a jaguar must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.

\textbf{Pounce (Ex):} If a jaguar charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.

\textbf{Rake (Ex):} Attack bonus +8 melee, damage 1d3+2.

\textbf{Skills:} Jaguars have a +4 racial bonus on \skill{Hide} and \skill{Move Silently} checks. Jaguars have a +8 racial bonus on \skill{Balance}, \skill{Climb}, \skill{Jump}, and \skill{Swim} checks.

A jaguar can always choose to take 10 on a \skill{Climb} or \skill{Swim} check, even if rushed or threatened.

*In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the \skill{Hide} bonus improves to +8.
