\textbf{Pounce (Ex):} If a lion charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.

\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex):} To use this ability, a lion must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.

\textbf{Rake (Ex):} Attack bonus +7 melee, damage 1d4+2.

\textbf{Skills:} Lions have a +4 racial bonus on \skill{Balance}, \skill{Hide}, and \skill{Move Silently} checks. *In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the \skill{Hide} bonus improves to +12.
