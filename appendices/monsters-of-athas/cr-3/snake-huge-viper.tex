\textbf{Poison (Ex):} Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Con. The save DC are Constitution-based.

\textbf{Skills:} Snakes have a +4 racial bonus on \skill{Hide}, \skill{Listen}, and \skill{Spot} checks and a +8 racial bonus on \skill{Balance} and \skill{Climb} checks.

A snake can always choose to take 10 on a \skill{Climb} check, even if rushed or threatened.

Snakes use either their Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for \skill{Climb} checks, whichever is higher.

A snake has a +8 racial bonus on any \skill{Swim} check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a \skill{Swim} check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
