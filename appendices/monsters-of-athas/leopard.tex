\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex):} To use this ability, a leopard must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.

\textbf{Pounce (Ex):} If a leopard charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.

\textbf{Rake (Ex):} Attack bonus +6 melee, damage 1d3+1.

\textbf{Skills:} Leopards have a +8 racial bonus on Jump checks and a +4 racial bonus on \skill{Hide} and \skill{Move Silently} checks. Leopards have a +8 racial bonus on \skill{Balance} and \skill{Climb} checks. A leopard can always choose to take 10 on a \skill{Climb} check, even if rushed or threatened. *In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the \skill{Hide} bonus improves to +8.
