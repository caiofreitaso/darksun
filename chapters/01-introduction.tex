\Chapter{Introduction}
{For thousands of years, the Tablelands have remained untouched: its politics frozen in a delicate stalemate, its life in a balance even more delicate. It is true that the Dragon Kings amused themselves with their petty wars, rattling sabers to punctuate the passing of ages. It is true that, occasionally, another city would be swallowed by the wastes.

But there were no surprises. The Dragon Kings steered everything from their omnipotent perches, content in their superiority, but ever thirsting for challenge. All that has changed. The Tablelands have been thrown into turmoil, the likes of which have not been seen since times forgotten. The Dragon Kings have been thrown into confusion, grasping for the tedium they so recently lamented.

And yet I fear the worst is yet to come. Change is in the air, and change has never come gently to Athas.}{Oronis, sorcerer-king of Kurn}

\Capitalize{D}{ark} Sun 3.5 is a new edition of the {\tableheader Dark Sun} campaign setting, written as a revision of athas.org's {\tableheader Dark Sun} 3 rulebook and the \emph{Athasian Emporium}. This rulebook condenses all d20 System information available under OGL, including psionic rules, but it also changes the system a bit. In addition, you might find useful to download the \emph{Terrors of Athas} (ToA), \emph{Terrors of the Dead Lands} (TotDL), and \emph{Faces of the Forgotten North} (FFN), since this book does not contain information on monsters.

This document is intended for an audience already familiar with the {\tableheader Dark Sun} campaign setting, and does not attempt to detail the world of Athas in full. For more information on Athas, visit \url{www.athas.org}---the official {\tableheader Dark Sun} website. In addition to the latest version of this document, you may find other {\tableheader Dark Sun} material available as free downloads.

All {\tableheader Dark Sun} products published by TSR may be purchased from RPGNow! as PDF downloads.

\section{Where to Begin}
Players should begin by creating their {\tableheader Dark Sun} character after reading the first seven chapters of this book. Players may also want to read the timeline in order to understand the history of Athas. Remember to discuss with your DM before creating your character to find out what options and other books are allowed in his campaign.

The DM should start with \chapref{Life on Athas} and read material relevant to the locations, \chapref{Campaigns} for guidelines and tips when running your campaign, and \chapref{Others Ages of Play} to understand more about the era of play on which your campaign will focus.

\subsection{What You Need to Play}
This book contains revisions on the material from the three core rulebooks for {\tableheader Dungeons \& Dragons v3.5} and the \emph{Expanded Psionics Handbook} released under Open Game License (OGL). Throughout this book, superscript abbreviations are often used to denote game elements that appear in certain supplements: \emph{Complete Adventurer} (CAd), \emph{Complete Arcane} (CAr), \emph{Complete Champion} (CC), \emph{Complete Divine} (CD), \emph{Complete Mage} (CM), \emph{Complete Psionics} (CP), \emph{Complete Scoundrel} (CS), \emph{Complete Warrior} (CW), \emph{Player's Handbook II} (PH2). Having any of all of these supplements will enhance your enjoyment of this book, but they are not required.

\subsection{What Changed?}
Many new options were added to previous base classes, and some have been completely rewritten. Getting inspiration on the {\tableheader Dungeons \& Dragons 5e}, advantage and disadvantage were added to the system as well as multiclass prerequisites for base classes. Spell lists, domains, and magical items were changed. For a summary of all the changes between the d20 System rules under OGL and this book, see \apxref{Changes from d20 System}.

% There are changes between the original \url{www.athas.org} rulebook and this revision, with some prestige classes being excluded, and others being reworked. New feats were also added and some of the previous ones were reworked. For a summary of all the changes between the \url{www.athas.org} rulebook and this book, see \apxref{Changes from Dark Sun 3}.
