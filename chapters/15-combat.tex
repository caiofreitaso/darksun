\Chapter{Combat}
{Looking back now, I wonder what I was thinking. I knew that elves rarely trusted outsiders, and threatening them with exposure was foolish.

The elven trader responded to my threat by swinging a dagger at my neck. Her first swipe was so fast I barely saw it; the sharp blade cut a deep score in my left shoulder. We scuffled briefly, but in the close confines of the trading room she could not use her greater speed to advantage, and I was much stronger. I was forced to kill her, although she wounded me more than once before our struggle ended.}{Esreva's Journal}

\Capitalize{W}{hether} in a gladiatorial arena, a battlefield in the middle of city-state wars, or surviving in the wasteland, adventurers in {\tableheader Dark Sun} find themselves entangled in combat situations. This chapter provides the rules to solve those combat situations.

\section{How Combat Works}
Combat is cyclical; everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle of rounds. Combat follows this sequence:

\begin{enumerate*}
\item Each combatant starts out flat-footed. Once a combatant acts, he or she is no longer flat-footed.

\item Determine which characters are aware of their opponents at the start of the battle. If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens before regular rounds of combat begin. The combatants who are aware of the opponents can act in the surprise round, so they roll for initiative. In initiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take one action (either a standard action or a move action) during the surprise round. Combatants who were unaware do not get to act in the surprise round. If no one or everyone starts the battle aware, there is no surprise round.

\item Combatants who have not yet rolled initiative do so. All combatants are now ready to begin their first regular round of combat.

\item Combatants act in initiative order (highest to lowest).

\item When everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest initiative acts again, and steps 4 and 5 repeat until combat ends.
\end{enumerate*}
