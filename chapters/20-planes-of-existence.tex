\Chapter{Planes of Existence}

\Capitalize{P}{lanes} of existence make up the cosmology of any campaign setting. These planes correspond to entire universes with their own laws of physics and idiosyncrasies. They can be dangerous, wondrous, and specially strange.

The spells required to reach other planes are all 6th level or higher, making planar adventures more recommended for high-level characters. These adventures require not only the characters to be able to reach the planes, but they also must survive the unusual environments in those planes.
