\Chapter{Items of Power}
{A village can prosper or die with the utterance of a single syllable. Toxic water can be purified or deadly plague can be unleashed by the power of nature contained in a clay tablet or bone fetish. A ring could save a dying man or protect the land from being reduced to ash by defilers, or help destroy them both. A crystal could dominate the will of its possessor, or serve as a storage of psychic energy. Even mundane looking objects can contain highly sought after power, which makes every item a potential treasure or curse.}{The Oracle, Blue Shrine Scrolls}

Items of power come in two types: magic items and psionic items. Magic items are divided into categories: armor, weapons, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, and wondrous items. In addition, some magic items are cursed. Psionic items are divided into: cognizance crystals and intelligent items.

Finally, a few items of power are of such rarity and power that they are considered to belong to a category of their own: artifacts. Artifacts are classified in turn as minor (extremely rare but not one-of-a-kind items) or major (each one unique and extremely potent).

\textbf{Armor and shields:} Magic armor (including shields) offers improved, magical protection to the wearer. Some of these items confer abilities beyond a benefit to Armor Class.

\textbf{Weapons:} Magic weapons are created with a variety of combat powers and almost always improve the attack and damage rolls of the wielder as well.

\textbf{Potions:} A potion is an elixir concocted with a spell-like effect that affects only the drinker.

\textbf{Rings:} A ring is a circular metal band worn on the finger (no more than two rings per wearer) that has a spell-like power (often a constant effect that affects the wearer).

\textbf{Rods:} A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power unlike that of any known spell.

\textbf{Scrolls:} A scroll is a spell magically inscribed onto paper or parchment so that it can be used later.

\textbf{Staffs:} A staff has a number of different (but often related) spell effects. A newly created staff has 50 charges, and each use of the staff depletes one or more of those charges.

\textbf{Wands:} A wand is a short stick imbued with the power to cast a specific spell. A newly created wand has 50 charges, and each use of the wand depletes one of those charges.

\textbf{Wondrous Items:} These objects include magic jewelry, tools, books, clothing, and much more.

\textbf{Cognizance Crystals:} A cognizance crystal resembles a piece of elaborate jewelry. It stores power points that can be used later by any psionic creature or character.

\textbf{Intelligent Items:} An intelligent item is an item with its own will and psionic powers. It can be any non-consumable item, such as jewelry, rod, armor or weapon.
