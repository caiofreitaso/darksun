\Chapter{Equipment}
{I have heard tales that suits of clothing fashioned from metal have even been found from time to time. It is generally agreed that these were worn by warriors to protect against the blows of enemy weapons. I can only speculate that the climate must have been far cooler in those ancient days. Any fool that would wear such clothing now would die faster from heat stroke than he would have from the weapons of his foes. Still, the idea that there was once enough metal in the world to allow such a garment to have been manufactured astounds me.

There are even rumors that mounds of steel, silver, and gold lie hidden in the deepest tunnels of certain forlorn cities. I have never seen such a thing myself, but if such treasures exist, they will reward those who find them most handsomely. Those who control such stores of metal can buy food, power, influence, and sometimes even the sorcerer-king's protection.}

{\tableheader Dark Sun} characters must be well equipped in order to endure the rigors of Athas. This chapter covers a variety of topics related to mundane equipment that every hero needs to survive and prosper.

% \section{Equipping a Character}
% The world of Athas has a very specific feel to it; many things that are taken for granted in other campaign worlds, like the availability of metal and water, are very different on this heat-wracked planet. To maintain this feel, the equipment available to characters should reflect these differences.
