\Chapter{Adventuring}
{Beyond the Sea of Silt there is a land of forests and lakes, where the sun is a kiss of warmth and the earth is rich and fertile. There the mountains are made of iron, and the streambeds are strewn with gold. And the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky fill the air with song and gladness, and no creature kills another. Some day this bliss shall be ours as well, when the sorcerer-kings are no more and the Dragon but a legend told to frighten children.}{From the dwarven saga of Mordek, the Hero of the Rising Sun}
