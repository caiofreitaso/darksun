\Chapter{Magic}
{The Tablelands are a giant wasteland, to the untrained eye barren and devoid of life. When people see plants wither and die when someone utters mysterious phrases accompanied by unknown gestures, they assume the worst. They cry wizard and the mob instantly gathers to kill him. But if people venture into the wastes and look under the rocks, they will learn that Athas is teeming with all sorts of life. And when the vermin swarm forth to envelop them, biting and crawling into every orifice, do they see the irony?}
{The Oracle, Blue Shrine Scrolls}

\Capitalize{T}{he} abuse of magic has shaped and scarred the world of Athas in the past 8,000 years. Because of that magic is universally feared and hated by the general populace. Wizards are outlaws that are hunted and killed by templars. Magic is hard to find, and even low-level spells are not easily accessible.

A spell is a one-time magical effect. Spells come in two types: arcane (cast by wizards) and divine (cast by clerics, druids, experienced rangers, and templars). Some spellcasters select their spells from a limited list of spells known, while others have access to a wide variety of options.

Most spellcasters prepare their spells in advance---whether from a spellbook or through devout prayers and meditation---while some cast spells spontaneously without preparation.

Despite these different ways that characters use to learn or prepare their spells, when it comes to casting them, the spells are very much alike.

Cutting across the categories of arcane and divine spells are the eight schools of magic. These schools represent the different ways that spells take effect.
