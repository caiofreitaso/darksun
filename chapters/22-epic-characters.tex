\Chapter{Epic Levels}
{
`Three thousand, one hundred and fifty-seven years in this place! What am I doing here? What do I hope to accomplish when it's done? I already know the damage this can inflict on the land, so why do I keep trying to perfect it? What if all of this set me back one step towards returning Athas to its former glory, but later on it will be two steps forwards it? I am willing to make this sacrifice. It will all be worthy.'

Then, with renewed energy, he went back once again to the final piece of the puzzle. An epiphany suddenly struck him: `Yes, the path is all too clear to me now.' He left his chambers, never looking back. After a while, the deformed creature emerged from the porous rock tower. He knew Athas would never be the same again.

Epic characters in {\tableheader Dark Sun} earn the power to drastically change their environment, for better or for worse. They can become the leaders of mighty armies, cruel tyrants ruling with iron fists, beings of pure psionic
energy, elemental champions battling for their patron's superiority, or become a force of hope and renewal for Athas' abused landscape.

Differently from other {\tableheader D\&D} settings, it is very hard to become epic in Athas without ever being noticed by the general populace, and worst, it is harder yet to go unnoticed by those who hold the reins of power. It is almost impossible to do so without attracting at least some (unwelcome) attention.

\subsection{Epic Characters in Your Game}
Athas is a harsh world, where survival itself is not a mundane task, let alone living enough to be able to thrive. Advancing into epic levels is extremely difficult, since victims of their own success. Powerful forces, such as the sorcerer-kings or the mysterious Order constantly look for potential threats and eliminate them before they have a
chance to fight back. Sometimes it is even impossible to become one, unless a character starts preparing years, maybe decades, in advance.

The most powerful epic creatures in Athas must be able to wield both magic and psionics, since only the clarity of mind resulting in practicing the Way would prepare their minds for the traumatic metamorphosis they must go through in order to become truly advanced beings.
