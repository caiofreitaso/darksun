\Chapter{Epic Levels}
{
`Three thousand, one hundred and fifty-seven years in this place! What am I doing here? What do I hope to accomplish when it's done? I already know the damage this can inflict on the land, so why do I keep trying to perfect it? What if all of this set me back one step towards returning Athas to its former glory, but later on it will be two steps forwards it? I am willing to make this sacrifice. It will all be worthy.'

Then, with renewed energy, he went back once again to the final piece of the puzzle. An epiphany suddenly struck him: `Yes, the path is all too clear to me now.' He left his chambers, never looking back. After a while, the deformed creature emerged from the porous rock tower. He knew Athas would never be the same again.

Epic characters in {\tableheader Dark Sun} earn the power to drastically change their environment, for better or for worse. They can become the leaders of mighty armies, cruel tyrants ruling with iron fists, beings of pure psionic
energy, elemental champions battling for their patron's superiority, or become a force of hope and renewal for Athas' abused landscape.

Differently from other {\tableheader D\&D} settings, it is very hard to become epic in Athas without ever being noticed by the general populace, and worst, it is harder yet to go unnoticed by those who hold the reins of power. It is almost impossible to do so without attracting at least some (unwelcome) attention.

\subsection{Epic Characters in Your Game}
Athas is a harsh world, where survival itself is not a mundane task, let alone living enough to be able to thrive. Advancing into epic levels is extremely difficult, since victims of their own success. Powerful forces, such as the sorcerer-kings or the mysterious Order constantly look for potential threats and eliminate them before they have a
chance to fight back. Sometimes it is even impossible to become one, unless a character starts preparing years, maybe decades, in advance.

The most powerful epic creatures in Athas must be able to wield both magic and psionics, since only the clarity of mind resulting in practicing the Way would prepare their minds for the traumatic metamorphosis they must go through in order to become truly advanced beings.

\section{Epic Level Basics}
Epic characters---those whose character level is 21st or higher---are handled slightly differently from nonepic characters. While epic characters continue to receive most of the benefits of gaining levels, some benefits are replaced by alternative gains. A class can be advanced beyond 20th level. A ten-level prestige class can progress beyond 10th level, but only if the character level is already 20th or higher. A class with fewer than ten levels cannot progress beyond the maximum for that class, regardless of character level.

If your group is using the traditional leveling system via XP, you can use \tabref{Traditional Experience and Wealth}. In this table there is the expected wealth of player characters. Use this as a guide to balance adventures, i.e., do not assume a 23rd-level character should have a 762,000 cp item.


\Table{Traditional Experience and Wealth}{lRRR}{
\tableheader ECL & \tableheader Total XP & \tableheader XP for next level & \tableheader Wealth\\
20 & 285,000 & 30,000 &   378,000 cp\\
21 & 315,000 & 31,500 &   474,000 cp\\
22 & 346,500 & 33,000 &   570,000 cp\\
23 & 379,500 & 34,500 &   762,000 cp\\
24 & 414,000 & 36,000 &   954,000 cp\\
25 & 450,000 & 37,500 & 1,146,000 cp\\
26 & 487,500 & 39,000 & 1,530,000 cp\\
27 & 526,500 & 40,500 & 1,914,000 cp\\
28 & 567,000 & 42,000 & 2,298,000 cp\\
29 & 609,000 & 43,500 & 3,066,000 cp\\
30 & 652,500 &        & 3,834,000 cp\\
}

\subsection{Adding a Second Class}
When a single-class epic character gains a level, they may choose to increase the level of their current class or pick up a new class at 1st level. The standard rules for multiclass characters still apply.

\input{subsections/epic-levels/epic-level-basics/divine-rank.tex}

\subsection{Psionic Enchantment}
Beyond the horizons of routine magic are whole seas of power that cannot be tapped naturally. The unaided mind, regardless of intelligence, cannot comprehend, let alone command, such tremendous energy. But psionics can ``tune'' the mind for greater mastery of magic. The combination produces the most powerful magic available in a {\tableheader Dark Sun} campaign.

In psionic enchantment, psionics is a means toward an end, a catalyst in the magical process. Spells beyond 9th-level are too difficult for the unaided mind to comprehend. Only through psionic disciplines can the mind handle this magic.

In game terms, psionic enchantments are new spells for the highest-level spellcasting characters who are also manifesters. Psionic enchantments are 10th-level spells that become available for spellcasters that have reached the 21st level of a spellcasting class and access to all six psionic disciplines. Casting a psionic enchantment requires spending 50 power points, besides the spell slot of 10th-level.

Characters without manifesting abilities do not have access to the spell slots. Specialist wizards do not gain additional spell slots for psionic enchantments---these spell slots do not work with the normal arcane regimes and cannot be manipulated in the same way.

\section{Epic Class Progressions}
Because the \chapref{Character Classes} contains information on advancement only up to 20th level in any given class, this chapter expands each class's progression up to the 30th level.

Casting a psionic enchantment requires spending 50 power points, besides the spell slot of 10th-level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a psionic enchantment is 20 + the epic wizard's Intelligence modifier.

\textbf{Familiar:} An epic wizard's familiar continues to increase in power.

\Table{Epic Familiar Progression}{b{1.4cm} Z{1.2cm} c X}{
