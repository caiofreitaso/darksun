\chapter{Spells}

An M or F appearing at the end of a spell's name in the spell lists denotes a spell with a material or focus component, respectively, that is not normally included in a spell component pouch. An X denotes a spell with an XP component paid by the caster.

\textbf{Order of Presentation:} In the spell lists and the spell descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains.

When a spell's name begins with ``lesser,'' ``greater,'' or ``mass,'' the spell description is alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.

\textbf{Hit Dice:} The term ``Hit Dice'' is used synonymously with ``character levels'' for effects that affect a number of Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with Hit Dice only from their race, not from classes, have character levels equal to their Hit Dice.

\textbf{Caster Level:} A spell's power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster's class level for the purpose of casting a particular spell. A creature with no classes has a caster level equal to its Hit Dice unless otherwise specified. The word ``level'' in the spell lists that follow always refers to caster level.

\textbf{Creatures and Characters:} The words ``creature'' and ``character'' are used synonymously in the spell descriptions.
