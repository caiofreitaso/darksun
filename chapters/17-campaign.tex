\Chapter{Campaigns}
{Bards tell tales of the fall of King Kalak of Tyr, the great rebellion and liberation of the slaves, and the war against Urik. It is the life of Rikus the gladiator and his fellow comrades. Elders speak of ancient ruins where undead walk at night, where powerful defilers seek secrets so terrible the Sorcerer-Kings tremble. Travelers dream of hidden cities in the Silt Sea, of forgotten cities to the North closed off to the world around them, and of strange halfling cities, beyond which are the vast Hinterlands of the kreen. Some whisper of sighting strange beings, a forewarning of invasions of kreen, undead or dray. Athas calls for new heroes and villains. Who will rise to answer the call?}{The Oracle, Blue Shrine Scrolls}

The world of Athas has a slightly different flavor from traditional high fantasy. With a combination of survival against, ecological disaster, resource depletion, survival of the fittest, slavery and poverty, and the wide-spread use of psionic abilities, it has the potential to handle a wide range of adventures. The world has been scarred and forever changed by the abuse of magic and a terrible war that lasted over a millennia. In the aftermath, a handful of individuals with powers akin to gods in other settings and other powerful groups fight to gain power and influence.
