\Chapter{Equipment}
{I have heard tales that suits of clothing fashioned from metal have even been found from time to time. It is generally agreed that these were worn by warriors to protect against the blows of enemy weapons. I can only speculate that the climate must have been far cooler in those ancient days. Any fool that would wear such clothing now would die faster from heat stroke than he would have from the weapons of his foes. Still, the idea that there was once enough metal in the world to allow such a garment to have been manufactured astounds me.

There are even rumors that mounds of steel, silver, and gold lie hidden in the deepest tunnels of certain forlorn cities. I have never seen such a thing myself, but if such treasures exist, they will reward those who find them most handsomely. Those who control such stores of metal can buy food, power, influence, and sometimes even the sorcerer-king's protection.}
{The Wanderer's Journal}

Dark Sun characters must be well equipped in order to endure the rigors of Athas. This chapter covers a variety of topics related to mundane equipment that every hero needs to survive and prosper.

% \section{Equipping a Character}
% The world of Athas has a very specific feel to it; many things that are taken for granted in other campaign worlds, like the availability of metal and water, are very different on this heat-wracked planet. To maintain this feel, the equipment available to characters should reflect these differences.

\section{Wealth and Money}
\subsection{Coins}
All prices in Dark Sun are given in terms of ceramic pieces, the most common coin. Ceramics are made from glazed clay and baked in batches once a year in a secure process supervised by the high templar that supervises the city's treasury. Bits are literally one‚Äêtenth parts of a ceramic piece---the ceramic pieces break easily into ten bits. Some cities' ceramic pieces have small holes that can be threaded onto a bracelet or necklace. The lowest unit of Athasian trade is the lead bead (bd).

Each of the city-states of the Tablelands produces its own currency. All cities use ceramic pieces as the most common coin, but also mint silver coins and, in some cases, rare and highly prized gold coins.

\Table[\scriptsize]{Currency Conversions}{l C C C C}{
& \multicolumn{4}{c}{\tableheader Exchange Value}\\
& \tableheader bd & \tableheader bit & \tableheader cp & \tableheader sp\\
Lead bead (bd) & 1 & 1/10 & 1/100 & 1/1,000\\
Ceramic bit (bit) & 10 & 1 & 1/10 & 1/100\\
Ceramic piece (cp) & 100 & 10 & 1 & 1/10\\
Silver piece (sp) & 1,000 & 100 & 10 & 1\\
Gold piece (gp) & 10,000 & 1000 & 100 & 10\\
}

\subsubsection{Moneychangers}
Adventurers that travel between cities will need to change their currency for local currency at each city they visit. With a couple of exceptions, the city-states have moneychangers available for incoming visitors. Located near the city gates and in large market places, moneychangers denote their business by hanging a large purple banner from their shop. The banners are always purple, but the moneychangers in each city-state display a different emblem on the banner, based on their city's standard.

Moneychangers charge each customer a fee to change coins. The fees differ by city and are summarized on \tabref{Moneychangers}.

\Table{Moneychangers}{C C}{
\tableheader City & \tableheader Exchange Rate\\
Balic & 6\%\\
Draj & 8\%\\
Gulg & 10\%\\
Kurn & 16\%\\
Nibenay & 14\%\\
Raam & 12\%\\
Tyr & 12\%\\
Urik & 9\%\\
}

These fees are averages and may vary slightly. There are of course many unscrupulous money merchants who will charge as much as they can get away with. Moneychangers in Kurn are rare but a couple do exist. Since metal coins from any city-state are readily accepted by local merchants and no corresponding Kurnish coins exist there is little need to exchange such coins. There are, however, a few moneychangers willing to exchange ceramic pieces.

There are two cities that do not have moneychangers. Visitors to Celik have no need of a moneychangers, as merchants in that city take coins of all types. Nor are there any moneychangers in Eldaarich. Since Eldaarich has been shut off from the rest of the land for so long, visitors needing to exchange money have been nonexistent, so no moneychangers have set up business.

\subsection{Trade}
In general, the Athasian economy in the cities is relatively stable thanks to the Merchant Houses. Under normal conditions, supply is ample thanks to the caravans traveling back and forth between the cities. However, for smaller communities and trade outposts the price situation on certain goods can sway drastically. A raider attack or sandstorm can result in lack of necessities such as food and water, for which people will pay almost any amount of coin. Coins are not the only means of exchange. Barter and trade in commodities is widespread.

Dune traders commonly exchange trade goods without using currency, instead relying on a basic bartering system.


\Table{Trade Goods}{l X}{
\tableheader Cost & \tableheader Item\\
4 bits & One kilogram of salt\\
6 bits & One kilogram of grain or faro\\
1 cp & One kilogram of lead\\
2 cp & One kilogram of nuts, or one kilogram of kank nectar\\
4 cp & One square meter of cotton (cloth)\\
10 cp & One kilogram of obsidian, or one square meter of silk, or one metric ton of water, or one erdlu\\
50 cp & One herding kank, or one aprig\\
100 cp & One kilogram of copper, or one male carru, or one inix\\
200 cp &  One kilogram of iron, or one mekillot\\
300 cp & One female carru\\
1,000 cp & One kilogram of silver\\
10,000 cp & One kilogram of gold\\
}

\subsection{Selling Loot}
In general, a character can sell something for half its listed price.

Trade goods are the exception to the half-price rule. A trade good, in this sense, is a valuable good that can be easily exchanged almost as if it were cash itself.
