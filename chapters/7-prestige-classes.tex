The prestige classes in this chapter are designed for characters in an Athasian campaign. They make use of defiling rules, the characters classes described in Chapter 2, or allow characters to further develop their
elemental powers.

In addition to those prestige classes, characters in a {\tableheader Dark Sun} campaign can adopt any prestige classes---with the DM's permission---from other sources as well. This chapter is not a comprehensive guide to the prestige classes on Athas. Check the \href{http://athas.org/products/prc1}{Prestige Class Appendix I} and \href{http://athas.org/products/prc2}{Prestige Class Appendix II} for more Athasian prestige classes.
