Prestige classes offer a new form of multiclassing. Unlike the basic classes, characters must meet Requirements before they can take their first level of a prestige class. The rules for level advancement apply to this system, meaning the first step of advancement is always choosing a class. If a character does not meet the Requirements for a prestige class before that first step, that character cannot take the first level of that prestige class. Taking a prestige class does not incur the experience point penalties normally associated with multiclassing.

% The prestige classes in this chapter are designed for characters in an Athasian campaign. They make use of defiling rules, the characters classes described in Chapter 2, or allow characters to further develop their elemental powers.

In addition to the prestige classes presented in this chapter, characters in a {\tableheader Dark Sun} campaign can adopt any prestige classes---with the DM's permission---from other sources as well. This chapter is not a comprehensive guide to the prestige classes on Athas. Check the \href{http://athas.org/products/prc1}{Prestige Class Appendix I} and \href{http://athas.org/products/prc2}{Prestige Class Appendix II} for more Athasian prestige classes.
