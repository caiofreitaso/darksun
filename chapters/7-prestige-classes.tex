\Chapter{Prestige Classes}
{There are many paths to power, but all power comes at a price. Fame or infamy follows those who make great sacrifices and who reach grand achievements. Would you be called tyrant or savior, I wonder. Perhaps you would prefer to be addressed as Mighty One, or plain and simply by your birthname? Will the bards speak of you as delusional or omnipotent? It all depends on the eye that sees. The hero of one is villain to another. But all beings of power share one trait---each has its own secrets. Remnants of the past, stories of the now, or visions of the future---secrets are the source of power. And the keepers of the greatest secrets are the most dangerous of all beings, for they will use any means to prevent others from unveiling them.}{The Oracle, Blue Shrine Scrolls}

\Capitalize{P}{restige} classes offer a new form of multiclassing. Unlike the basic classes, characters must meet Requirements before they can take their first level of a prestige class. The rules for level advancement apply to this system, meaning the first step of advancement is always choosing a class. If a character does not meet the Requirements for a prestige class before that first step, that character cannot take the first level of that prestige class. Taking a prestige class does not incur the experience point penalties normally associated with multiclassing.

% The prestige classes in this chapter are designed for characters in an Athasian campaign. They make use of defiling rules, the characters classes described in Chapter 2, or allow characters to further develop their elemental powers.

In addition to the prestige classes presented in this chapter, characters in a {\tableheader Dark Sun} campaign can adopt any prestige classes---with the DM's permission---from other sources as well. This chapter is not a comprehensive guide to the prestige classes on Athas. Check the \href{http://athas.org/products/prc1}{Prestige Class Appendix I} and \href{http://athas.org/products/prc2}{Prestige Class Appendix II} for more Athasian prestige classes.
