\section{Combat Modifiers}
Sometimes you just have to go toe-to-toe in a fight, but you can usually gain some advantage by seeking a better position, either offensively or defensively. This section covers the rules for when you can line up a particularly good attack or are forced to make a disadvantageous one.

\subsection{(Un)Favorable Conditions}
% \subsection{Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions}
Depending on the condition of attackers or defenders, they may gain bonuses or penalties as stated in \tabref{Attack Roll Modifiers} and \tabref{Armor Class Modifiers}.

\subsection{Proficiencies}
A character who uses a weapon with which they are not proficient gets disadvantage on attack rolls.

A character who wears armor and/or uses a shield with which they are not proficient takes the armor's (and/or shield's) armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all Strength-based and Dexterity-based ability and skill checks. The penalty for nonproficiency with armor stacks with the penalty for nonproficiency with shields

Weapon, armor, or shield proficiency may be granted by the character's race, class or by the following feats:

\begin{itemize*}
\item \feat{Armor Proficiency (Light)}
\item \feat{Armor Proficiency (Medium)}
\item \feat{Armor Proficiency (Heavy)}
\item \feat{Exotic Weapon Proficiency}
\item \feat{Martial Weapon Proficiency}
\item \feat{Shield Proficiency}
\item \feat{Simple Weapon Proficiency}
\item \feat{Tower Shield Proficiency}
\end{itemize*}

\subsection{Underwater Combat}
Land-based creatures can have considerable difficulty when fighting in water. Water affects a creature's Armor Class, attack rolls, damage, and movement. In some cases a creature's opponents may get a bonus on attacks. The effects are summarized in the accompanying table. They apply whenever a character is swimming, walking in chestdeep water, or walking along the bottom.

\textbf{Ranged Attacks Underwater:} Thrown weapons are ineffective underwater, even when launched from land. Attacks with other ranged weapons take a $-2$ penalty on attack rolls for every 1.5 meter of water they pass through, in addition to the normal penalties for range.

\textbf{Attacks from Land:} Characters swimming, floating, or treading water on the surface, or wading in water at least chest deep, have improved cover (+8 bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) from opponents on land. Landbound opponents who have freedom of movement effects ignore this cover when making melee attacks against targets in the water. A completely submerged creature has total cover against opponents on land unless those opponents have freedom of movement effects. Magical effects are unaffected except for those that require attack rolls (which are treated like any other effects) and fire effects.

\textbf{Fire:} Nonmagical fire (including alchemist's fire) does not burn underwater. Spells or spell-like effects with the fire descriptor are ineffective underwater unless the caster makes a \skill{Spellcraft} check (DC 20 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the spell creates a bubble of steam instead of its usual fiery effect, but otherwise the spell works as described. A supernatural fire effect is ineffective underwater unless its description states otherwise. The surface of a body of water blocks line of effect for any fire spell. If the caster has made a \skill{Spellcraft} check to make the fire spell usable underwater, the surface still blocks the spell's line of effect.
