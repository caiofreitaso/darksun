\section{Character Progress}
As the characters overcome the numerous challenges in the course of the adventure, they should improve and gain new abilities to overcome greater challenges.

\subsection{Advancing in Level}
Instead of the standard of using Experience Points (XP) to attain new character levels as is described in the Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide, we recommend that players gain levels based on the number of sessions for your adventure. And it can also depend on the frequency of the sessions, e.g., if your group can only play once per month it may be better to speed up the progress of the characters.

\Table{Sessions Per Level}{X R}{
\tableheader Pace of Campaign & \tableheader Number of Sessions per Level\\
Rushed & 1\\
Fast & 2\\
Default & 3\\
Slow & 4\\
Dragged & 5+\\
}

Since the traditional leveling system via XP was tailored for 13.33 encounters per level, this would mean that the default pace is based on having between 4 and 5 encounters per session.

\subsubsection{Level-Dependent Benefits}
Besides the bonuses given by their character classes, all characters gain additional feats and increase their abilities from advancing in level as seen in \tabref{Level-Dependent Benefits}.

\textbf{Feat:} Every character gets their first feat at 1st level. At 3rd level and every other 3 levels, characters gain another feat. More information on feats on \chapref{Feats}.

\textbf{Ability Score Increase:} At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the player chooses one of their character's ability scores to increase by 1 point. This improvement is permanent.

\Table{Level-Dependent Benefits}{X C C}{
\tableheader Character Level & \tableheader Feat & \tableheader Ability Score Increase\\
1 & 1st & \\

3 & 2nd & \\

\subsection{Gaining Experience}
Award players for combat and role-playing. These are some guidelines to award experience points players for their roleplay. If you are using experience points to advance levels, multiply these awards by the character's effective character level (ECL).
