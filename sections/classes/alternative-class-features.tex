\section{Alternative Class Features}
Choosing a class fixes key aspects of a character: their role, their abilities, and their attack and save bonuses. However, you can change a class feature to provide a new experience. Variant versions of several of class features are presented below. If you prefer the variant to the standard class feature, ask your game master if he approves of your swapping out your class feature for the variant version.

These alternative class features can exist side by side with the standard class features---some bards might work alone while their comrades favor having contacts all over Athas---or can completely replace the standard features. The balance between the standard class features and the alternative features is up to the game master.

The description of alternative class features is the following.


\subsection{Class Name}
\subsubsection{Alternative Class Feature Name}
A general description of the ability.

\textbf{Special Requirement:} Any special requirements that you must meet before selecting the alternative class feature. Many of the alternative class features described here require ranks of a skill. Since skill ranks are purchased before class features are selected, you can meet this requirement at the same level that you gain the alternative class feature.

\textbf{Level:} The alternative class feature can be selected only at this level. In some cases, different levels might be given for different classes.

\textbf{Replaces:} The ability that you must sacrifice to gain the alternative class feature.

\textbf{Benefit:} The mechanical effects of the new ability.


\subsection{Bard}
\AlternateClassFeature{Contact}
{Instead of relying on their own wits like a traditional bard, a \emph{draqoman} relies on the help of others more capable in specific matters. Draqomen serve as guides and translators for newcomers to the cities. Local laws and customs vary by location, and a local resident who knows the city like the back of his hand and can call in a favor if necessary is definitely worth his pay. A draqoman will usually be loyal as long as he is paid and fed well. Mistreat your draqoman and you will soon find yourself on the wrong end of someone's blade or in the prisons run by the templars.}
{\skill{Diplomacy} 2 ranks, \skill{Gather Information} 4 ranks, \skill{Knowledge} (local) 4 ranks.}
{6th, 11th, and 16th.}

\AlternateClassFeature{Procurer}

{You do not gain trap sense.}

If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + \onehalf the rogue's class level + the rogue's Int modifier) against the kill effect, he dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the rogue. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the rogue has completed the 3 rounds of study, she must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.
