\section{Character Progress}

DMs use adventures to offer a number of challenges (or encounters) for the characters to overcome. As the characters overcome these encounters, they should improve and gain new abilities to overcome greater challenges. The rate of encounters is called the pace of the adventure, or the pace of the campaign. \tabref{Paces of Campaign} shows how many encounters or sessions are expected for each type of campaign.

\Table{Paces of Campaign}{X R R}{
\tableheader Pace of Campaign & \tableheader Encounters per Level & \tableheader Sessions per Level\\
Rushed & 5 encounters & 1 session \\
Fast & 10 encounters & 2 sessions \\
Default & 12 encounters & 3 sessions \\
Slow & 15 encounters & 4 sessions \\
Dragged & 20 encounters & 5+ sessions \\
}

Instead of the standard of using Experience Points (XP) to attain new character levels, we recommend that players gain levels based on a fixed number of sessions. This way the DM can tailor the experience based on the frequency of the sessions, e.g., if your group can only play once per month it may be better to speed up the progress of the characters.

If your group would rather use a traditional leveling system via XP, you can use \tabref{Traditional Experience and Wealth}. In this table there is the expected wealth of player characters. Use this as a guide to balance adventures, i.e., do not assume a 3rd-level character should have a 3,000 cp item.

\Table{Traditional Experience and Wealth}{lRRR}{
\tableheader ECL & \tableheader Total XP & \tableheader XP for next level & \tableheader Wealth\\
1 & --- & 1,500 & 3d4 $\times$ 10 cp\\
2 & 1,500 & 3,000 & 600 cp\\
3 & 4,500 & 4,500 & 1,500 cp\\
4 & 9,000 & 6,000 & 3,000 cp\\
5 & 15,000 & 7,500 & 6,000 cp\\
6 & 22,500 & 9,000 & 9,000 cp\\
7 & 31,500 & 10,500 & 12,000 cp\\
8 & 42,000 & 12,000 & 18,000 cp\\
9 & 54,000 & 13,500 & 24,000 cp\\
10 & 67,500 & 15,000 & 30,000 cp\\

15 & 157,500 & 22,500 & 114,000 cp\\
16 & 180,000 & 24,000 & 138,000 cp\\
17 & 204,000 & 25,500 & 186,000 cp\\
18 & 229,500 & 27,000 & 234,000 cp\\
19 & 256,500 & 28,500 & 282,000 cp\\
20 & 285,000 & --- & 370,000 cp\\

\subsubsection{Level-Dependent Benefits}
Besides the bonuses given by their character classes, all characters gain additional feats and increase their abilities from advancing in level as seen in \tabref{Level-Dependent Benefits}. This does not count a race's level adjustment---only character classes.

\textbf{Feat:} Every character gets their first feat at 1st level. At 3rd level and every other 3 levels, characters gain another feat. More information on feats on \chapref{Feats}.

\textbf{Ability Score Increase:} At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the player chooses one of their character's ability scores to increase by 1 point. This improvement is permanent.

\Table{Level-Dependent Benefits}{X C C}{
\tableheader Character Level & \tableheader Feat & \tableheader Ability Score Increase\\
1 & 1st & \\
2 & & \\
3 & 2nd & \\
4 & & 1st \\
