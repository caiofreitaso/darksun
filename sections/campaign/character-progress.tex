\section{Character Progress}
DMs use adventures to offer a number of challenges (or encounters) for the characters to overcome. As the characters overcome these encounters, they should improve and gain new abilities to overcome greater challenges. The rate of encounters is called the pace of the adventure, or the pace of the campaign. \tabref{Paces of Campaign} shows how many encounters or sessions are expected for each type of campaign.

\Table{Paces of Campaign}{XRR}{
  \tableheader Pace of Campaign
& \tableheader Encounters per Level
& \tableheader Sessions per Level \\

Rushed  &  5 encounters & 1 session \\
Fast    & 10 encounters & 2 sessions \\
Default & 12 encounters & 3 sessions \\
Slow    & 15 encounters & 4 sessions \\
Dragged & 20 encounters & 5+ sessions \\
}

Instead of the standard of using Experience Points (XP) to attain new character levels, we recommend that players gain levels based on a fixed number of sessions. This way the DM can tailor the experience based on the frequency of the sessions, e.g., if your group can only play once per month it may be better to speed up the progress of the characters.

If your group would rather use a traditional leveling system via XP, you can use \tabref{Traditional Experience and Wealth}. In this table there is the expected wealth of player characters. Use this as a guide to balance adventures, i.e., do not assume a 3rd-level character should have a 3,000 cp item.

\subsection{Awards per Story}
Feel free to award story awards when players conclude a major storyline or make an important accomplishment. These awards should be worth double the amount of experience points for a CR equal to the APL. Particularly long or difficult story arcs might award even more, at your discretion as GM.
