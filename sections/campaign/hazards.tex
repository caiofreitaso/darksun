\section{Hazards}
Hazards are natural dangers that adventurers might encounter during their stay on a dangerous zone. A seemingly safe room of a dungeon might cave-in after a convoluted battle, or a mountain hike might be in the way of an avalanche. None of these dangers are constructed specifically to hurt the adventurers, but they must find a way to survive them. Each hazard has a Challenge Rating as a trap does, and characters earn XP for encountering them.
