\textbf{Agriculture:} A big enough settlement needs a spellcaster whose job is to cast \spell{plant growth} on the city's crops. One such spellcaster is required for every 2,000 people---it can be a earth cleric of 5th- to 8th-level, a ranger 11th-level or higher, or a druid 12th-level or higher.

Clerics of 9th-level or higher are called to help with planar duties from their elemental masters, rangers need to be of high enough level to be able cast the spell, while druids are required to wander until they reach the 12th-level.

\textbf{Health:} It is expected to exist a cleric or druid that can cast \spell{remove disease} for every 15,000 people. For smaller communities, there is one priest to attend to a big number of villages and tribes. For big cities, their priests would attend to the city and its satellite towns.

\subsubsection{Community Population and Wealth}
\subsubsection{NPCs in the Community}
\textbf{Highest-Level NPC in the Community for Each Class:} Use the following tables to determine the highest-level character in a given class for a given community. Determine the appropriate community modifier by consulting the first table below; then refer to the second table, roll the dice indicated for the class, and apply the modifier to get a result.

A result of 0 or lower for character level means that no characters of that kind can be found in the community. The maximum level for any class is 20th.
