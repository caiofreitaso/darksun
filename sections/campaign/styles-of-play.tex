\section{Athasian Style}
{\tableheader Dark Sun} supports several styles of play---hack and slash, survival and political intrigue, to name a few. The ideal adventure weaves these elements together, combining action and high drama with mystery and betrayal. An adventure can focus on one genre over the other for a change of pace, but the best campaigns use combine several of these elements as the adventure progresses.

An adventure entirely set in a city-state may have less focus on survival and be more focused on intrigue and deception, but it still could include a few fight scenes when, for example the characters are caught in the middle of a Veiled Alliance attack, or a rival bribes a templar patrol to get rid of the PCs. On the other hand, an expedition to explore UnderTyr or to explore a ruin recently discovered after an aftershock has an entirely different tone, though intrigue can be added with mercenaries hired from a merchant house following the PCs in case they find anything interesting.



\subsection{Creating a Party}
When players create characters, they should work with you and each other to determine their history, and to give the characters a reason to be together from the very beginning. How do they know each other? Why are they working together? Consider the following possibilities.

\textbf{Slavery:} The player characters share the fate of shackles and servitude. They can be gladiators fighting for their lives in the arenas, laborers toiling in the Smoking Crown mines, or as builders constructing the grand monuments of the sorcerer-kings. Were they born in captivity? Were they captured and sold into slavery, or were they sentenced for their crimes?

\textbf{Rebellion:} King Kalak of Tyr was overthrown by an unlikely band of heroes, which liberated all slaves in the city, and fought off the advancing army of Hamanu of Urik come to claim Tyr's iron mines. Today the city faces many challenges. Did the player characters participate in the rebellion? Which side were they on? Were they freed from captivity? Did they fight in the war against Urik?

\textbf{King's Service:} The sorcerer-kings rule their domains with an iron fist, and their enforcers are feared and loathed. Political intrigue, corruption, assassinations and intimidation accompany those employed in the king's service. Player characters can assume the roles of templars, royal defilers, myrmeleons and other agents of the king, or as mercenaries employed by such individuals.

\textbf{Dune Traders:} Caravans trek across the deserts and fierce rivalries exist between new and established trade houses. Either through business operations of their own, or by working for a merchant house, the player characters are involved with trade. Are the characters mercenaries? Do they work for a small or large house? Do they follow the Merchant Code, and where do their allegiances truly lie?

\textbf{Wastelanders:} Those who eke a living in the Athasian wilderness must protect themselves from the dreaded sun, forage for food and defend scarce water supplies. Nomadic elves and herders, ex-slaves and raiders, and savage humanoids all fight for survival in the wastelands.



\subsection{What Every Adventure Needs}
A {\tableheader Dark Sun} adventure has a style and flavor all its own. To take full advantage of everything this setting has to offer, keep the following guidelines and principles in mind when you create an adventure for your players.


\subsubsection{Alignment Is Blurry}
No one is truly evil or good under the Crimson Sun. Athas is a world of contrasts, fanaticism and survival. Slave gladiators fight battles to the death for the entertainment of the masses. The Veiled Alliance are preservers who seek the downfall of the sorcerer-kings, using terrorist attacks to achieve their goals. Defilers fuel their magic with plant life, bringing the planet one step closer to its doom for every spell they cast. Finally, the Dragon of Tyr kept Rajaat imprisoned through rituals involving periodic sacrifices of thousands of people to prevent the return of its former master, who would destroy all of Athas in a mad quest to restore the world to the Blue Age.

Also, life threatening circumstances always put a character's alignment to the test. How he acts, how he treats the other characters in a party, and how he controls his own actions can change drastically with desperation.


\subsubsection{Blood and Bone}
Athas is a brutal world ravaged by dark sorcery. Slavery, blood sport, abuse and corruption are part of city-life. In the wilderness, every day is a fight for survival. Savage beasts, raiding tribes and deadly vegetation challenge player characters over scarce water supplies. The sun itself drains away a character's life. The only certainty is death. Never let the player characters feel safe and remind them constantly of how harsh life on Athas is.


\subsubsection{Opportunism}
In a world where survival and struggle for power dominate the way of life, concepts such as ethics and morality are increasingly rare. Unscrupulous traders, corrupt templars, abusive slavers and elven smugglers all represent Athasian walks of life. Where opportunities arise, some will seek to claim them. Player characters should face temptations and opportunities that will define their nature and challenge their beliefs. Will they act in selfish opportunism to improve the conditions for themselves and their allies, or do the player characters strive for rare ideals such as fairness and equality?


\subsubsection{Price of Power}
Characters who rise to power attract attention. Warriors seek champions to lead them on daring raids and engage wars on old enemies. Templars in positions of power become the targets of plots from ambitious rivals. The sorcerer-kings constantly watch for wizards who could one day challenge them, and take measures to eliminate them if no one else does. Rogues and bards who do not pledge loyalty to a noble family soon find themselves with a choice to swear fealty with a knife at their throat, while psionicists will be watched closely by the Order until the day they are to be judged.

Never let the player characters rise to power without facing contenders and those who would seek to profit from their fortune. On Athas, power always comes at a price.



\subsection{Plot Themes}
{\tableheader Dark Sun} can support a host of different styles of adventure plots, but a few basic plot themes are particularly well suited to the world. This section looks at a few of these themes.


\subsubsection{Freedom}
\Quote{Freedom has its own shackles. Why trade the whip for an empty stomach?}{Borac, tarek slave}
\Figure{b}{images/slave-1.png}

\textbf{Description:} The characters are gladiatorial slaves that entertain arena spectators. A slave, who has not been seen for some time, returns to his cell, babbling like a madman. He rants about a passage and ``the guardian''. The guards throw the slave into the arena to die in combat with a lirr, while puzzled slaves begin to whisper about a road to freedom.

The PCs could escape slavery in the arena if they find the passage and get past its guardian. It turns out that the guardian is an undead spirit protecting a long forgotten shrine. The characters must fight or negotiate with the spirit to be allowed passage to the surface and gain their freedom.

\textbf{Primary Challenge:} Finding the passage and making it past the raaig that guards the forgotten shrine.

\textbf{Secondary Challenge:} Guards following the PCs, traps and debris in the ancient underground passage.

\textbf{Combat:} Moderate.

\textbf{Basic Structure:} Finding the passage is a matter of tracing the dead slave. He used to perform maintenance work in the arena, and was last working in the lower floors. The passage is partially hidden beneath some rubble. After clearing the rubble, the player characters will have to make their way through a dungeon which threatens to collapse, while making their escape from guards in pursuit. The main challenge is getting past a raaig that guards a shrine dedicated to an elemental lord, which requires sacrifice of an intelligent humanoid to allow passage to the characters. Once past the raaig, there is a passage leading to a clay brick wall, which the characters must break through or find another means to get past. If they do, they are free.


\subsubsection{Politics}
\Quote{Do templars hold the power or does the power hold them?}{Saniara of the Veiled Alliance}
\Figure{b}{images/discussion.png}

\textbf{Description:} A mission to protect a merchant takes a new turn when the player characters are caught in a power struggle between three templars. They must tread carefully in the political environment of the Templarate---or risk imprisonment or worse.

\textbf{Primary Challenge:} Avoid committing crimes that incriminate templars.

\textbf{Secondary Challenge:} Fights with thugs.

\textbf{Combat:} Infrequent.

\textbf{Basic Structure:} Templar Saram hires the player characters to protect a merchant. Unbeknownst to them, they and the merchant are pawns in a power struggle between three templars. The merchant is a witness in a trade court matter with much prestige and a promotion on the line for the involved templars.

If the characters save the merchant when he is attacked by thugs, Templar Saram will be pleased---as this will secure his promotion. However, the templar who sent the thugs, Templar Gilas, will be furious as he loses face and his promotion to Saram.

The losing templar will approach the characters and offer them the chance to redeem themselves---by killing the rival. If they do not cooperate, he threatens to have them imprisoned and sentenced to the slave pits, a threat he is capable of carrying out. If the characters comply and actually murder a templar, they will be betrayed. Soldiers and templars will arrive on the scene of the crime and the characters are caught red handed. The characters will be imprisoned and sentenced for this heinous crime, unless they manage to escape, in which case they will become wanted fugitives. If, on the other hand, the characters inform the templar they have been instructed to assassinate of their assignment, they will be offered to testify against templar Gilas in the presence of his superiors. If the characters agree, they will be attacked by thugs on the way to the Templarate. If they make it to the Templarate and testify, Gilas will be arrested and immediately sentenced to death.

Regardless of whether they are imprisoned for the murder or testify against the templar who instructed them, the characters are approached by a third templar, Templar Kali. She also seeks the position Saram and Gilas are fighting over, and she offers to release the characters or reward them in return for their service. Unlike the two men, Kali's plan will not involve violence. She wants the characters to plant false evidence on the remaining of the two rivals, connecting him to another sorcerer-king. If they accept, they receive a templar sigil from another city-state. The characters are instructed to visit the male templar and hide the symbol in his office. Shortly after they leave the office, Kali will arrive with superiors to have it searched and the ``traitor'' exposed.

If the player characters do as instructed by Kali, and manage to hide the templar sigil without being noticed, events unfold as described. The ``traitor'' is arrested and executed, and Kali receives the promotion. However, she will take measures to have the characters removed as they may incriminate her. On the other hand, if the characters inform the remaining templar of Kali's instructions, he will prepare for her arrival and have her humiliated in front of her superiors. She will not be promoted, but she will not dare to strike against the characters as they will be under the protection of the then promoted Saram or Gilas.


\subsubsection{Search for the Truth}
\Quote{If we can discover the truth we may yet attain the glory of the ancients. Somewhere out there buried beneath tons of sand and dust, lost in centuries of fire and blood, is an Athas that we have never known: a world of abundance and splendor, where honor is as precious as water.}{The Wanderer's Chronicle}
\Figure{b}{images/resting-3.png}

\textbf{Description:} The party must uncover a part of Athasian history. This is typically a short-term challenge; once the ruin is found, the long-lost object is returned, or the truth is exposed, things return to normal. Most people are too concerned with the problems of the present to devote themselves to the lessons of the past. The few who have any interest in history are the flattering lackeys of sorcerer-kings undertaking the project to glorify their sovereign. The resulting chronicles are implausible fables or mutually incompatible fabrications.

\textbf{Primary Challenge:} With a search for the truth, the primary challenge is intellectual---getting the facts straight, identifying why it needs to be found, and locating it. This requires more roleplaying and skill/spell use than direct combat.

\textbf{Secondary Challenges:} On the other hand, it can be very dangerous to go looking for secrets. The characters may have to fight agents of the sorcerer-kings, ancient undead or other people who don't want the truth to be known. Once they have learned the truth, it may take a battle to see justice done.

\textbf{Combat:} Infrequent.

\textbf{Basic Structure:} Party has a problem to be solved that needs information from the past, either by being contacted by a patron or by having it affect them.

\textit{Initial investigation:} Attempt to identify people involved, examining relevant locations. Opportunity for initial threats and a cliffhanger moment.

Pieces begin to come together, which is the time to insert an unexpected twist. As the party gets closer to the truth, chance of dangerous opposition increases.

Mystery solved, but situation not yet resolved. Can the characters see that justice is done? 

Aftermath. Are there any loose ends? Is there a reward to be had, or coconspirators to round up?


\subsubsection{Survival}
\Quote{The sun is merciless. My men wager whether it or the roaming beasts do you in first.}{Resan, raider leader}
\Figure{b}{images/combat-2.png}

\textbf{Description:} The characters are survivors after a raid on a caravan. Abandoned with no food or water, and only a handful of weapons, they have to find a way to survive and make it to safety.

\textbf{Primary Challenge:} Survive the rigors of the desert and reach the nearest trading fort.

\textbf{Secondary Challenge:} Roaming monsters, raiding tribe, beasts and vegetation at oasis.

\textbf{Combat:} Frequent.

\textbf{Basic Structure:} Left standing in the heat of the sun by the remains of a caravan after a raider attack, the player characters will have to scavenge what they can from among the remains of the wagon and the dead. There is no food or water, but there are a handful of weapons that can be picked up.

The characters may learn that a trade outpost is approximately five days on foot from their current location. Before they can think of this destination, they will have to find food and water and shelter from the sun. The trip to the trade outpost is perilous as roaming monsters can be encountered both day and night, and at the only oasis within miles, they encounter wild beasts and bramble weed. There are traces of someone living at the oasis; a dwarf druid who tends to the land, who is skeptical towards strangers, and thus remains hidden if she can. If the characters stay for too long, a band of raiders will show up again and this time they will seek to finish off the characters.

When the player characters finally reach the trade outpost, most of the residents are suffering from wind sickness (see Dregoth Ascending) after a M'ke caravan stopped by a week ago. The player characters themselves risk infection, and the administrator says he will pay them handsomely if they can find a cure.

The characters may opt to look for the druid at the oasis, or they can track the raiders back to their camp. The druid can help---if the characters bring her the body of a wizard that is in the service of the trade outpost. The wizard is a preserver who has served the merchant house that owns the trade outpost loyally for years, but the administrator is willing to sacrifice him for a cure. The druid is adamant in her demands, as she views all wizards as potential defilers.

Should the characters travel to the raider camp; the raiders will seek to capture them. They will be harassed and tied to stakes, left to die under the crimson sun. Unless the characters find a way to escape, they will die by dehydration or attacks from wild beasts that pick up their scent.
