\section{Archetypes}
Besides a backstory, a character has a certain identity beyond their past, an archetype. It can be due to their social status, their way of living, or even due to their isolation. This is generally who the character was before they start adventuring. A noble who used to attend to her family's business until she got bored, or a homeless man who got tired of the city's streets and decided to hop onto a caravan to see what's beyond the city walls.

\textbf{Archetype Skill:} Every archetype has one skill designated as the archetype skill, the most representative skill of the archetype no matter what choices a character of this archetype takes. This skill is treated as a class skill in all respects for all classes that character has levels in, both current and future.

\textbf{Bonus Feat:} Archetypes also provide a bonus skill feat. This feat gives a +2 bonus to two skills that are not the same as the archetype skill. This feat represents the adjacent skills that the archetype has aptitude, but it's not widely recognized as a \emph{master} at that field.
