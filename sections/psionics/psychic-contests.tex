\section{Psychic Contests}
When another psionic character uses a power on the same target as you, you may need to make an opposed power check. If you succeed, your power wins the contest in this round and the power effects apply to your benefit. If you lose, the opposing character's power apply to their benefit. In either case, the loser's power stops being maintained.

In the case of a tie, both of you should maintain the powers and engage in another psychic contest next round. If any character fails to maintain the power, they take 1d6 nonlethal damage for every level of the power.

Only powers of the compulsion and manipulation subdisciplines require psychic contests when multiple characters use a power on the same target. Other individual powers may require psychic contests for specific situations (such as, \psionic{detect remote viewing}, \psionic{mind bar}, \psionic{psychic noise}, \psionic{spacetime anchor}).
