\section{Beyond the Tablelands}
Plenty of action and adventure can be found across Athas. More lands of wonder, mystery, and danger exist beyond the barrenness of the Tablelands. A quick tour of these other places follows, and more information about specific locations will be revealed in future products.

% Pterran Vale
% the other side of the Ringing Mountains. Trade routes are
% being established with Tyr and areas beyond.
% Government and Politics
% As in all pterran communities, Pterran Vale is lead by
% a Triumvirate. The Triumvirate is made up of the eldest
% member from each of the three primary Life Paths. The
% Triumvirate has the power to make all decisions for the
% community. However, before important decisions are
% made the entire community gathers to debate the question
% in front of the Triumvirate. Only after all pterrans have
% had their say does the Triumvirate make their decision.
% Power Groups
% Traders: Recently, the prestige of the merchants of
% Pterran Vale, lead by Ptellac Goldeye, has been growing.
% Since they are at the forefront of the pterrans’ new push to
% make contact with civilizations outside of their vale, the
% traders have become well respected. In addition, the new
% trade routes they have developed to the cities of the
% Tablelands have brought them increased wealth.
% The traders are not an organized group as yet.
% Thought the different merchants are business rivals some
% have begun to recognize their new found status and how
% if they united, they could exert significant influence over
% the pterran society of the Hinterlands.
% Major Settlements
% Pterran Vale is the largest community of civilized
% pterrans in the Hinterlands. The buildings are lodges
% constructed from the bones and hides of large creatures,
% such as mekillots, built over hollowed out pits. Each
% building has steps leading down into the interior. Lost Scale (Small Town, 2,000): Centuries ago, a
% religious dispute resulted in a schism in Pterran Vale. One
% group found itself in the minority and chose to leave
% Pterran Vale and establish their own community, and
% founding Lost Scale. Today the disagreement has long
% been settled and the two communities work together.
% Lost Scale is noted for its legion of expert pterrax
% riders. Each of these warriors searches rocky badlands
% and canyons for a pterrax egg. The baby pterrax that
% hatches is raised and trained from birth by its rider.
% Life and Society Adventure Ideas
% Population: 4,000 (99% pterran, 1% other)
% Exports: bones tools, livestock
% Languages: Pterran
% The pterrans of Pterran Vale survive by hunting,
% farming, and herding. In addition to using bone in the
% construction of their buildings, they make fine bone
% weapons and tools.
% Each pterran must choose a life path when they come
% of age. There are three main Life Paths, the Path of the
% Warrior, the Path of the Druid, and the Path of the Psion.
% However, other lesser Life Paths, farmer, crafter, traders,
% and herders, also exist. Those pterrans following one of
% the lesser Life Paths are treated with respect but the three
% primary Life Paths are more prestigious. All leaders are in
% pterran society are selected from the primary Life Paths.
% The pterrans revere Athas as the Earth Mother, and
% their religious ceremonies and celebrations are devoted to
% her. After the Great Earthquake, the pterrans became
% convinced that the earthquake was a call from the Earth
% Mother to them, directing them to become more involved
% with the affairs of others. In response, explorers have been
% sent out resulting in contact with the city‐state of Tyr on
% ―After the success of Ptellac Goldeye’s effort to make
% contact with the cities of the Tablelands, the leaders of
% Pterran Vale have decided to send emissaries to the south,
% where rumors state long lost communities of pterrans
% exist. While the rumors are indeed true, the pterrans of
% the south have long ago degenerated into barbarism and
% cannibalism, making the expedition fraught with peril.
% ―Pterran scouts have witnessed thri‐kreen with
% unusual coloration herding trin packs into a large
% enclosure in the desert. Concerned as to who these
% strange thri‐kreen are and why they are herding trin, the
% leaders of Pterran Vale send the PCs to investigate.
% ―The crops in the fields around Pterran Vale are not
% growing as healthily as they normal do. The farmers
% quickly discovered why. Blood grass has sprouted up
% throughout the fields, stealing nutrients from the crops
% and attacking farmers who approach too close.
% Adventurers are needed to clear the blood grass from the
% fields, as well as discover how the blood grass came to be
% there in the first place.
% ―The pterrax riders of Lost Scale are having a
% problem locating pterrax eggs. It seems the pterrax have
% been driven from their normal nesting areas by an
% unusually large concentration of giant hornets. The
% pterrans hope the PCs can kill or drive off enough giant
% hornets to reduce the number to a balanced level so that
% the pterrax could return to their nesting area.
% ―The Dark One is a pterran outcast from Pterran
% Vale. An earth cleric, the Dark One was exiled for
% claiming the Great Earthquake and the aftershocks were
% calls from the Earth Mother demanding sacrifices of
% young pterrans. Now a hermit in the wilderness, the Dark
% One believes he has developed direct communication
% with the Earth Mother through a large hole in the ground.
% At the direction of the voice from this hole, the Dark One
% makes sacrifices to the Earth Mother by kidnapping and
% throwing pterrans into the hole. However, the Dark One
% is being manipulated by an earth drake, who poses as the
% Earth Mother to have the Dark One drop food into its lair.
% ―A pack of dune freaks have migrated to an oasis
% near Pterran Vale, posing a hazard to travelers going
% north. The PCs could be asked to clean out the dune
% freaks; however, they are only a lesser evil. The dune
% freaks were forced out of their normal hunting grounds
% by the increased patrols of zik‐trin coming from the Great
% Rift.
% Saragar
% Population: 30,000 (85% humans, 6% elves, 6%
% dwarves, 2% other)
% Exports: Metal weapons, puddingfish cloth, fresh
% water
% Languages: Saragarian
% Separated from the rest of the region by the Burning
% Plains and the Thunder Mountains, the city of Saragar sits
% on the shores of the Last Sea, called Marnita by
% Saragarians. Visitors from the Tablelands would consider
% Saragar a miracle. All of the drudge work performed by
% slaves in other cities is taken care of by the minds of
% ancient criminals trapped forever in obsidian spheres. The
% streets are cleaned, cattle herded, crops tended, garbage
% removed, and water purified by these psionic powered
% spheres.
% The only price the citizens must pay to have all of
% their needs looked after in this way is that they must
% remain happy. The primary law of Saragar is, “Happiness
% must be maintained!”
% Life and Society
% For the most part Saragar maintains a closed self‐
% sufficient society. To visit Saragar is to step back into the
% Green age. People dress in tabards and gowns befitting a
% less savage age. The relatively cooler climate in the vale
% makes such clothing practical and comfortable. There is
% an abundance of metal in Saragar compared to the
% Tablelands, though most of it is ancient and shows signs
% of wear. Some new sources of ore exist in the surrounding
% mountains, but few citizens of Saragar still know how to
% extract it, let alone forge it into new items.
% Someone from the city‐states of the Tyr region might
% consider Saragar to be a paradise. That certainly is the
% perception the Triune Mind Lords try to propagate. They
% generate laws to bolster the illusion of happiness and
% serenity but do nothing to truly address those concerns.
% The lawkeepers enforce these rules. For this reason the
% Saragar dwellers have learned to constantly display
% serene attitudes.
% There are no wizards of any sort in Saragar. Wizardry
% is considered evil and most citizens in Saragar who
% witness it don’t have any idea what they are seeing.
% Psionics are the true power of the domain.
% Government and Politics
% The basic form of Saragar’s government is a triune of
% lawmakers who write the city’s laws, an army of
% lawkeepers to enforce the laws, and a bureaucracy of
% lawtenders to perform the administrative function.
% The trio that make up Saragar’s Triune Mind Lords
% are powerful, ageless masters of psionics. They are Thesik
% (LE male mindlord human, kineticist 29), Barani (NE
% female mindlord human, telepath 28), and Kosveret (CE
% male mindlord elf, nomad 27). The citizens of Saragar
% consider the Mind Lords gods and treat them as such;
% thought there is little interaction between the Mind Lords
% and the populous.
% Senior Lawkeeper Efkenu (LN male human, psychic
% warrior 17) is the only person to have regular contact with
% the Mind Lords. He passes on their edicts and as head of
% the lawkeepers sees that their laws are enforced. Though a
% fair man, Efkenu makes no distinctions between the types
% of offenses and all criminal acts are punished in the same
% manner. The accused is taken to the harmonizers. The
% harmonizers are psions who reach into a subject’s mind to
% sift and shape thoughts back to the track the Mind Lords
% have dictated.
% The lawkeepers are as corrupt as any templar. They
% enforce the laws arbitrarily and to suit their own desires.
% Supervisors rarely leave their offices to check on their
% subordinates and only rebuke subordinates for their
% behavior if it interferes with their own plans.
% The lawtenders perform all of the administrative
% work. They tend to be the most optimistic of people,
% determined that there is no problem that cannot be solved
% with a little determination and positive thinking. While
% they are not corrupt like the lawkeepers, the lawtenders
% are not very good administrators. They insist on only
% performing their duties by the book, and refuse to
% delineate from their guidelines no matter how inefficient
% or incorrect those guidelines are.
% Power Groups
% The Underground: Despite the relative pleasantness
% of Saragar, there are some people who recognize that they
% are living in a society in decay; one that relies on powerful
% immortals for every aspect of their lives. These people
% make up the Underground which has been growing in
% Saragar for the past few hundred years.
% Most members of the Underground are just upset that
% their lives have become more inconvenient as some of the
% obsidian orbs have begun to fail. Others just like having
% someone to complain to without being arrested by the
% lawkeepers.
% A smaller group, who consider themselves the real
% Underground, speak out on street corners against the
% Mind Lords. They are always working on crazed schemes
% such as assassinating the Mind Lords, or destroying all of
% the obsidian orbs, but they lack the power to implement
% any of these plans.
% Important Sites
% The Distillery and the Water Tower: The distillery is
% a psionically powered factory used to transform salt water
% from the Last Sea into fresh water. The water is pumped
% from the distillery into the water tower which is
% connected to a citywide plumbing network that pipes
% fresh water into every building in Saragar.
% The Palace: A massive palace overlooks the city of
% Saragar from a hill east of the city. Unlike the palaces of
% the sorcerer‐kings, the palace of the Mind Lords was built
% more for awe‐inspiring beauty than for defense. The
% security provided by the lawkeepers is lax around the
% palace, as the Mind Lords are confident they could handle
% any intruder.
% Statues of the three Mind Lords stand on a circular
% base at the highest point of the palace. The base slowly
% rotates throughout the day powered by an obsidian
% sphere. The people of Saragar use the statues to tell time,
% as the statues complete a full rotation every hour.
% Major Settlements
% Blufftown (Thorp, 50): This small settlement sits on
% the side of a bluff on an isolated butte in the middle of the
% Last Sea called the Lonely Butte. The lawkeepers
% generally refuse to set foot on the Lonely Butte unless
% directly ordered to do so by the Mind Lords, which makes
% Blufftown a perfect safe haven for the Underground and
% other fugitives from the Mind Lords’ rule.
% The community is little more than a couple of inns
% sitting inside a cave in the side of a cliff. The only way to
% enter the village is to be hauled up in a device consisting
% of a large wicker basket and a series of ropes and pulleys
% powered by an obsidian orb.
% Cubarto (Small Town, 1,500): Cubarto is located on
% the opposite of side of Marnita from Saragar. The people
% of Cubarto are loud and lusty and would not fit in
% Saragar. With the lack of a presence of the lawkeepers,
% most people in Cubarto support the Underground,
% though discreetly. The villagers make their living off of
% fishing and trade coming into their port on its way to
% Kharzden or Sylvandretta. The village is known
% throughout the valley of the Last Sea for throwing a large
% party at the end of the year at which a large public feast is
% held.
% Kharzden (Large Town, 2,000): Kharzden is a
% Dwarven colony scattered through ancient mining shafts
% in the Thunder Mountains. Most of the veins of ore were
% mined out long ago, and most of the metal items the
% dwarves have are ancient. The Dwarven society is
% matriarchal and is lead by Queen Elakta. Her word is law
% and is to be obeyed by all. Queen Elakta refused to have
% much to do with the lawkeepers, and maintains the
% tradition in Kharzden of not calling for help from the
% lawkeepers. The dwarves live underground and grow
% subterranean crops in massive chambers underneath the
% mountains. The dwarves have always doubted the power
% of the Mind Lords to keep the rest of the world at bay,
% and tried to make their community as self sufficient as
% possible.
% Shallat (Hamlet, 300): Shallat is one of a number of
% small fishing villagers on the shores of Marnita. What
% makes the village stand out is the Shallat family who rules
% the villages. Each member of the Shallat family is a skilled
% physician and many are also water clerics. The Shallat
% healers provide their services to anyone in need, no
% matter who they are. The villagers of Shallat are fun‐
% loving people and are generally treated well by everyone
% living on the shores of the Last Sea. Even brigands and
% pirates do not harass the village, as potentially they might
% need the skills of the Shallat healers.
% Sylvandretta (Small Village, 500): The elves of
% Sylvandretta are called “ghost elves” by the people of
% Saragar because of their fair skin and their cold and aloof
% nature. The ghost elves believe that the purity of their
% bloodline must be preserved above all other concerns, and
% isolate themselves from the other races of the Last Sea
% region.
% The secluded settlement of Sylvandretta is located in
% the Spirit Forest nestled within a grove of trees of life. The
% community is run by a council of seven elders, elected by
% the general Elven population.
% Adventure Ideas
% ―Vikus and Mylandus are two merchants who run a
% successful business in Saragar until Mylandus disappears
% with most of the funds from the business. The PCs are
% hired by Vikus to track down his partner. Mylandus has
% discovered some secret that has scared him greatly
% enough that he has fled the city and is trying to leave the
% Last Sea area completely. Unfortunately for him,
% Mylandus has no idea how to survive in the devastated
% environment of the rest of Athas and will not survive long
% if he is able to find a way out of the area of the Last Sea.
% ―Jarsius, a tavern owner in Saragar, has begun to
% have disturbing visions, in which he sees himself
% behaving in random acts of violence. In actuality, the
% visions are memories. Jarsius was an active leader of the
% Underground until he was captured three years ago, but
% his memories were erased. The effect was not perfect and
% now some of his suppressed memories are returning.
% Members of the Underground still watch Jarsius, to see if
% he remembers what happened to him. For Jarsius’s mind
% was not destroyed by the lawkeepers but by members of
% the Underground who acted to mindwipe him to protect
% their identities.
% ―The lawkeepers based at South Pass discover the
% tracks of a large beast they have never encountered
% before. The PCs, as outlanders who may have seen such a
% beast before, are drafted to help track down the beast.
% ―A wealthy Saragarian wants to see what the world
% is like outside of the Last Sea. He hires the PCs to get him
% through the Border of Guardians.
% ―Because of the ragged appearance of most
% outlanders, the PCs are mistaken for druids by a small
% fishing community. The villagers ask the PCs for help
% with a school of sharks that is making fishing difficult in
% the area.
% ―A man is found beaten to death. His face was so
% badly beaten that the only way to identify him was by a
% letter found in his pocket. The letter was addressed from
% one of the PCs, and the lawkeepers wish to talk to the PC
% to see how he was involved with the murdered man. The
% PC has never heard of the man and has no idea why the
% dead man had the PCs name in his pocket.
% Thamasku
% Population: 12,000 (99% rhul‐thaun, 1% other)
% Exports: Life‐shapes, fish
% Languages: Rhul‐thaun
% The ancient rhul‐thaun city of Thamasku sits next to
% Ghavin Lake at the top of the Jagged Cliffs. The city is
% surrounded by a forest of hardwood trees. Like all rhul‐
% thaun communities, the buildings are constructed of
% organically grown material. The architecture focuses on
% the vertical, with most buildings having many storeys.
% There is one difference from other rhul‐thaun settlements.
% Because the city is not cramped onto a ledge of the Jagged
% Cliffs, the buildings of Thamasku are not crowded
% together allowing for wider streets and a more open feel
% for the city.
% Life and Society
% Rhul‐thaun society is highly ritualized. Each aspect of
% their lives has a ritual attached to it, and throughout the
% day the rhul‐thaun perform various rituals. Simple rituals
% from the greeting ritual to the payment ritual, to the
% before meal ritual last less than a minute, while more
% complex rituals such as those for legal procedures may
% last hours. Often the ritual is just as or more important
% than the associated action it is attached to, and if one of
% the participants makes a mistake the entire ritual is begun
% again. The rituals are more akin to superstitions than to a
% religious devotion, and allow a rhul‐thaun to feel he has
% some control over the chaotic forces that rule his life.
% As the center of the rhul‐thaun society, Thamasku has
% a diverse population. The wealthiest rhul‐thaun live side
% by side with the poorest of the cliff dwellers. The citizens
% of Thamasku are some of the few individuals on Athas
% who do not have to struggle daily to survive. Life‐shaped
% devices provide a vast array of conveniences and basic
% needs, from nourishment to waste disposal. Most homes
% have indoor plumbing, operated by life‐shaped engines
% that pump water from the lake.
% Because they do not struggle daily for survival, the
% rhul‐thaun of Thamasku have developed a rich culture of
% the arts and entertainment. Dance halls, theaters, art
% galleries, and auditoriums are numerous throughout the
% city, with many located in the Art Quarter on the city’s
% eastern side.
% Government and Politics
% The rhul‐thaun of Thamasku are divided into 28
% different clans. The clan leaders are called Har‐etuil. The
% Har‐etuil act as judges for matters within their clans.
% Disputes between clans are settled by a council of Har‐
% etuil. The collective of Har‐etuil appoints the city
% administrator.
% Currently, Vher‐asach (LN female rhul‐thaun, rogue
% 10) holds the title of city administrator, since she inherited
% the position from her mother. She has proved herself a
% capable administrator and most expect she will remain in
% the position for the time being.
% Power Groups
% Ban‐ghesh: A guild of thieves, assassins, and hired
% thugs, the ban‐ghesh runs the criminal activities in
% Thamasku. Extortion is the guild’s main source of income,
% though their activities include burglary, smuggling, and
% gambling. There is little to challenge the ban‐ghesh as
% they have a network of corrupt lawkeepers and
% administrative officials protecting their organization. The
% ban‐ghesh also enters into legitimate business with
% merchants, providing financial support in exchange for a
% percentage of the merchant’s profits.
% Chahn: The Chahn is a revolutionary organization
% which does not hesitate to use violence to achieve their
% goals. Their goal is the complete overthrow of rhul‐thaun
% society. The Chahn are against almost every tradition in
% rhul‐thaun society from clan‐rule, the mastery of the life‐
% shapers, to the daily rituals that dominate rhul‐thaun life.
% The lawkeepers have branded them a terrorist group and
% most rhul‐thaun live in fear of them.
% Life‐Shapers: The life‐shapers are a secret society that
% holds the knowledge of life‐shaped creations. They hold a
% place of reverence by the rhul‐thaun as the entire society
% is based on their works. Through the study of life‐shaping
% the life‐shapers feel a strong connection with the past back
% to the rhulisti, the inventors of life‐shaping. The life‐
% shapers feel they are superior to the rest of the rhul‐thaun,
% because of this connection.
% The life‐shapers guard their knowledge protectively,
% letting no one outside of their order learn their secrets.
% Because they control the creation of all life‐shaped items
% the life‐shapers can exert control over the all of the rhul‐
% thaun, forcing the Har‐etuil to listen to the life‐shapers’
% opinions strongly.
% The life‐shapers are led by Loi Far‐oneth (LG male
% rhul‐thaun, bard 7/life‐shaper 5) and his chief lieutenant,
% Gil‐ogres (LE male rhul‐thaun, rogue 5/graftwarrior 7),
% who reside at the Sanctuary in Thamasku. Each rhul‐
% thaun settlement has a life‐shaper sanctuary with a head
% life‐shaper who reports directly to Loi Far‐oneth and his
% lieutenant.
% Windriders: Windrider is the name given to the rhul‐
% thaun who dare to fly on the backs of various life‐shaped
% creatures through the high winds and mist that plague the
% Jagged Cliff. Traveling between the rhul‐thaun
% communities, they transport messages and merchant
% goods, allowing trade and communication between all
% their settlements. Windrider is the most glamorous
% position in rhul‐thaun society. Though there is a
% windriders guild, it maintains a loose organization with
% little structure or hierarchy. The windriders typically
% work in small independent groups of 2 to 8 windriders.
% Important Sites
% Air Temple: The air temple is located in one of the
% tallest of the city’s spires. A dozen clerics of air staff the
% temple, but they have little interaction with most of the
% city’s population. There are few devout followers in the
% city, and the clerics take no interest in politics. The air
% clerics do interact with the windriders regularly. In fact
% they have turned their temple into a safehome for
% windriders, where they can receive free food, a free room
% and lodging for their mounts. The clerics look on
% windriding as the ideal way to commune with the air
% spirits and treat the windriders as holy men.
% Aviary: The tall tower known as the aviary is home to
% hundreds of birds that fly about the city. The eclectic rhul‐
% thaun known only as the Birdmaster cares for and
% watches over the birds. The tower is large enough for
% large flying creatures to roost there, and the Birdmaster
% allows windriders to stable their mounts at the aviary for
% free when in the city.
% Conclave: The Conclave is the meeting hall of the Har‐
% etuil. It is a grand structure that sees little use when the
% Har‐etuil council is not in session.
% The Sanctuary: The Sanctuary is the headquarters and
% workplace of the life‐shapers in Thamasku. The
% mushroom shaped structure is located some 300 feet
% below the surface of Ghavin Lake. This masterpiece of
% life‐shaping technology maintains fresh air within the
% structure by extracting it from the surrounding water
% through a complex gill‐system. Over 150 life‐shapers
% work at the Sanctuary creating and maintaining the life‐
% shaped items that are used throughout Thamasku.
% Major Settlements
% Sol‐fehn (Hamlet, 300): Sol‐fehn is a small village
% located at the top of a waterfall created by a river flowing
% from Ghavin Lake. The village serves as a hub for goods
% and rhul‐thaun leaving Thamasku for the rest of the
% settlements scattered across the Jagged Cliffs. Almost all
% of the villagers make their living through transportation.
% The villagers are members of two clans that are centered
% in the city of Thamasku, so there is no Har‐etuil in the
% village. An administrator appointed by the administrator
% of Thamasku runs the city. The current administrator is
% Rath‐omak (LN male rhul‐thaun, fighter 5).
% Adventure Ideas
% ―No one has seen the Birdmaster of Thamasku for
% many weeks, but because of his reclusive nature, few
% citizens have realized this. So why are some of his birds
% following the PCs everywhere they go? Are the birds
% trying to send the PCs a message?
% ―The Ban‐ghesh claim they have managed to
% infiltrate the Sanctuary of Thamasku and steal a
% wonderful new type of life‐shaped item. There are rumors
% that the Ban‐ghesh plan to sell this new item to the Chahn.
% The life‐masters hire the PCs to recover the stolen item.
% The life‐masters are unconcerned with the item falling
% into the hands of the Chahn, because there is really
% nothing extraordinary about the item. It is simply an
% unfinished common life‐shaped tool. The life‐masters are
% more concerned about the slight of someone stealing from
% the Sanctuary.
% ―A high‐level reggelid believes that the secrets of
% Rajaat may be hidden in Thamasku. He has charmed a
% rhul‐thaun climber named Bal‐orean, and sent him to the
% rhul‐thaun capital. The reggelid seeks to create a web of
% charmed agents throughout the city, and so has Bal‐orean
% lure other rhul‐thaun to a secluded part of the Jagged
% Cliffs where the reggelid has its lair. Once there the victim
% is charmed and sent back to Thamasku, as the reggelid
% attempts to create a spy network in Thamasku to root out
% the location of Rajaat’s secrets.
% ―A wealthy benefactor hires the PCs to accompany
% him on a journey down the Jagged Cliffs to the Crimson
% Savanna to recover a long lost life‐shaped artifact hidden
% on the Savanna. Their employer is not who he claims to be
% however. Taen‐ofuth is really the high priest of the
% forbidden temple of fire in Thamasku. Frustrated with his
% lack of opportunity to demonstrate his devotion to his
% element, Taen‐ofuth desires to travel to the Crimson
% Savanna to set a massive brush fire. He seeks to revel in
% the fire’s destruction but also hopes to impress other rhul‐
% thaun into seeing the benefits of devotion to the element
% of fire.
% ―Two weeks ago, a windrider arrived at the air
% temple and went immediately into a private meeting with
% Thim‐obec, high priest of the temple. Two days later,
% Thim‐obec left Thamasku with the windrider and a high
% ranking life‐master on the windrider’s gon‐evauth. They
% have not been seen since, and the temple of air is seeking
% adventurers to find the high priest.
% ―Ghoun‐awir is famous windancer, known
% throughout Thamasku for her daring performances. After
% a recent performance, a wealthy citizen claimed that
% Ghoun‐awir is a thief and burglarized his home during
% her performance. The citizen’s home was used as part of
% the performance. Ghoun‐awir proclaimed her innocence
% before the lawkeepers arrived, but when they tried to
% arrest her she escaped. Since windancers wear face paint
% and costumes, no one is sure what Ghoun‐awir really
% looks like. PCs could be hired to track Ghoun‐awir down,
% or Ghoun‐awir could approach the PCs to help prove her
% innocence by finding the true criminal.
% Winter Nest
% Population: 650 (100% aarakocra)
% Exports: Ice, feathers
% Languages: Auran, Kurnan
% The village of Winter Nest is located in the frozen
% peaks of the White Mountains. It is the home of a civilized
% tribe of aarakocra.
% The unusual buildings of Winter Nest are formed
% from a mixture of ice, stone, and shaped bricks. To new
% visitors the village looks like a cluster of towers, giving
% the appearance that the mountain peak has a crown.
% There are no roads in Winter Nest and very few
% connecting walkways between the buildings, as the
% aarakocra fly rather than walk. Doorways appear all along
% the face of the buildings, though most are clustered near
% the top of each tower. Landing platforms and resting
% perches decorate the outsides of most building. Each
% tower is topped with a large rounded structure. Most of
% these sphere‐shaped constructs are communal areas,
% though the highest are the personal quarters of the leaders
% of Winter Nest.
% Life and Society
% The aarakocra of Winter Nest called themselves
% “silvaarak,” which means “people of the silver wing.”
% They are perceptive, and have great confidence and pride
% in themselves. This translates into arrogance at times,
% because the silvaarak believe that their ability to fly makes
% them superior to all other races. Though they often
% express sympathy for people unable to fly, this more often
% comes across as condescending.
% The aarakocra have had a difficult time forming
% friendly relations with others over the years. Only in Kurn
% have they made dedicated friends. Traders from Winter
% Nest visit the city‐state of Kurn a few times each year for
% trade. Other attempts to make contact with other
% communities have meet with failure. Either due to the
% hostility of the natives such as in Eldaarich and the Bandit
% States, or the silvaarak’s condescending nature towards
% other races.
% Government and Politics
% Winter Nest is lead by Traaka (LG female aarakocra,
% air cleric 5/elementalist 2) a female aarakocra of many
% years. Traditionally, the aarakocra are isolationists, and
% Traaka supports this policy. The isolationist policy was
% adopted years ago after bad experiences with Eldaarich
% and later with the peoples of the Bandit States. The policy
% has kept the village safe over the years and most of the
% silvaarak want to see it continue.
% However, many of the younger generation of bird‐
% people desire to explore the world beyond the White
% Mountains. They have been vocal in their wish to explore
% and make contact with other civilizations, believing they
% will not experience such bad receptions as those the
% aarakocra received in Eldaarich or the Bandit States.
% Pointing to Kurn, these young bloods believe there is
% opportunity for the silvaarak in positive relationships
% with outsiders.
% Traaka understands the young aarakocra’s desires, but
% wishes to maintain the status quo for the protection of the
% village. She is trying to develop a middle path that would
% allow some exploration without making the location of
% the village well known to its enemies.
% Power Groups
% Air Clerics: Winter Nest is ruled by clerics of Air and
% Ice drawn from the leading aarakocra families. The clerics
% meet in a large hall in Winter Nest to discuss community
% issues; when there is a particularly contentious debate, the
% priests adjourn to the very summit of a nearby mountain
% overlooking the village. There, perched on the ice and
% surrounded by the sky, the priests of the two faiths pray
% for guidance together.
% Important Sites
% Air Temple: The Air Temple is the grandest structure
% in the village. The temple is built like a huge brazier, with
% four legs made of massive evergreen tree trunks dragged
% up from the foothills centuries ago. These tree boles, each
% more than 100 feet long, are set in the icy ground and
% canted to nearly join at the tops. There is a concave plate
% of ice, 20 feet in diameter, held up between the four posts
% with a hole 8 feet in diameter cut in its center. Priests of
% Air preach from the center of the bowl, while congregants
% gather on the rim of the bowl and on the perches placed at
% intervals along the legs.
% Ice Temple: Smaller only to the Air Temple, the Ice
% Temple (which is basically another word for water at such
% high altitudes most of the year) is built of large sheets of
% translucent white and blue ice, layered upon one another
% to create a five‐sided pyramid more than 40 feet tall. The
% interior is sunken below ground level dug into the glacier
% so all the worshippers are surrounded by primordial ice
% throughout the services. Fresh plates of ice are added to
% the temple throughout the High Sun.
% Adventure Ideas
% ―Few in Winter Nest took much notice when a roc
% landed on a perch overlooking the village. Two days later
% the roc has been joined by a dozen more of his kind. The
% large birds rarely move from their perches, but their
% menacing presence is unnerving the aarakocra of Winter
% Nest.
% ―The wind patterns around Winter Nest have
% changed drastically. A dangerous downdraft has
% developed making any attempt at flying from the village
% fraught with peril. Town elders are puzzled by this
% sudden change, and have forbidden all but the strongest,
% most agile fliers from leaving Winter Nest. Air clerics are
% calling for a sacrifice to appease the air spirits, but the
% town elders want to understand what is going on before
% they decide, and the local druid who communes with the
% spirit of the land has disappeared.
% ―The aarakocra of Winter Nest tell tales of a wise old
% aviarag named Vocia that lives in a cave near the base of
% the White Mountains. The noble beast has not been seen
% for three years. Templars from Eldaarich, intent on
% plundering Vocia’s lair, have been spotted approaching
% the cave. Traaka needs volunteers to warn Vocia.
% Unfortunately Vocia has passed away due to old age,
% leaving the PCs to defend her cave, as well as her remains,
% which the templars wish to plunder.
% ―A defiler has polymorphed himself into an
% aarakocra and infiltrated Winter Nest, seeking to gain
% some of the knowledge from the preservers of Winter
% Nest. His defiling is having an adverse affect on the ice
% sculpted portions of Winter Nest’s buildings. If he is not
% unmasked soon, one or more buildings in the community
% may collapse.
% ―Some of the more adventuresome young aarakocra
% enjoy a deadly challenge. They know of a lair of an air
% drake on one of the other mountains in the White
% Mountain range. To show their bravery they occasionally
% sneak into the lair and come back with a scale or other
% souvenir. The act is not as dangerous as it sounds, since
% the aarakocra know the air drake’s migration pattern and
% typically know when it is not in this particular lair. Some
% of these youths could challenge the PCs to try this stunt,
% but unfortunately for the PCs the air drake has returned
% to the lair earlier than expected in order to lay eggs.
% ―A heavily armed Tsalaxan caravan has arrived at
% the foot of the White Mountains from Draj. The Tsalaxans
% seem to be trying to reach Winter Nest but the steep
% mountain sloop prevents them from approaching from
% below. They have not given up and continue to search for
% some path up the mountain to Winter Nest. The aarakocra
% believe the Tsalaxans are raiders and wish to avoid them.
% The Winter Nesters know their village cannot be reached
% except through the air, and are not concerned that the
% Tsalaxans will be able to reach the village. However,
% Traaka wishes to determine the caravan master’s true
% intentions in case the aarakocra are mistaken. PC allies of
% the aarakocra could infiltrate the caravan while not
% obviously tying directly back to the aarakocra.
