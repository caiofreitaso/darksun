\PrestigeClass{Master Scout}
{Stay away from the cacti... STAY AWAY from the cacti.}{Badu, caravan scout}
{Caravan masters, army commanders, raiding parties, adventuring groups, and anyone else traversing the hostile wilderness of Athas, all need the services of the master scout. Experienced wanderers and trackers who know every path and rock provide a safety and advantage valued by those who have come to know their services.}

{Rangers are natural candidates for the master scout class, with their extensive knowledge of the wastes and its creatures. Barbarians also make good scouts due to their fast movement. Thri-kreen, elves and other races with inborn speed and endurance make excellent master scouts, though few can compare with the flight capabilities of aarakocra scouts. Halfling master scouts use their natural aptitude for stealth to compensate for their lack of overland speed. Master scouts are usually mercenaries for hire, many of whom cater to adventurers, or they are members of slave, elf or halfling tribes.}

\textbf{Weapon and Armor proficiencies:} Master scouts are proficient in light armor and simple weapons.

\textbf{Blaze Trail:} The master scout is skilled at finding the best route through unfamiliar or obstructed areas and can guide others as well. Add 1.5 meter to the master scout's base speed. Up to one additional creature per master scout level can benefit from Blaze Trail. In Favored Terrains, the master scout may add an additional 1.5 meter to his own and his party's speed, due to familiarity with these terrains and areas.

\textbf{Hard March:} Due to his knowledge and experience of travel, add the master scout's Wisdom modifier (if positive) to Fortitude saves for enduring a forced march. Up to one additional creature per master scout level can benefit from Hard March.

\textbf{Swift Strike (Ex):} At 2nd level, you become skilled at taking down unwary targets quickly. You deal +1d6 points of damage on successful melee and ranged weapon attacks made against a flat-footed opponent. This extra damage can be lethal or nonlethal, as determined by the choice of weapon and the manner in which it's used.

The extra damage increases to +2d6 at 5th level and +3d6 at 8th level.

\textbf{Uncanny Stealth:} Master scouts learn to move quickly yet quietly. At 4th level, you no longer suffer the $-5$ penalty on \skill{Hide} and \skill{Move Silently} checks while moving at normal speed.

At 7th level, you suffer only a $-10$ penalty on \skill{Hide} and \skill{Move Silently} checks while running or charging (instead of the normal $-20$ penalty).

\textbf{Favored Terrain:} At 4th and 8th level you gain a favored terrain, as per the ranger class feature. This benefit scales with previously chosen favored terrains.

\textbf{Swift Tracker (Ex):} At 5th level, you can move at normal speed without penalty when using the \skill{Survival} skill to track. You can move at twice normal speed while tracking, but you take a $-10$ penalty on the check when doing so.

At 10th level, you receive no penalty on \skill{Survival} checks while running or charging.

\textbf{Bonus Feat:} At 6th level, the master scout has survived the Athasian wilderness and has become resilient from experience. He gains a bonus feat chosen from the following list: \feat{Endurance}, \feat{Great Fortitude}, \feat{Iron Will}, \feat{Lightning Reflexes}, \feat{Toughness}.

{nature}
{Master scouts take many names in each language, but all agree that they are instrumental for crossing the wastelands.}
{Master scouts move very quickly even tracking or while being stealthy.}
{Moving through the wastelands in small groups with master scouts may cut the time of travel by almost half when they are in their favorite terrain.}

Members with connections with a merchant house should have little problem contacting master scouts through house agents (\skill{Gather Information} DC 10).
