{
Chasseurs, or huntsmen, are wizards who specialize in hunting down others of their kind. Some chasseurs are found working for the Veiled Alliance hunting down defilers, while others are employed by the templars and the sorcerer-kings to hunt down preservers. Some do not answer to any authority at all, but have their own agendas. Whether a defiler or a preserver, a chasseur uses skill and magic to hunt down and kill or capture other wizards.

Chasseurs are usually elf, half-elf or human, though the rare aarakocra chasseur makes a dangerous airborne hunter. Many are multi-classed characters. Ranger/wizards excel at hunting down wizards traversing the wastes, while druid/wizards make vengeful and versatile enemies of all defilers. Urban rogue/wizards who become chasseurs sometimes take levels in the assassin class to focus on striking swiftly with deadly effect.

\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}: Chasseurs are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, net, light armor, and shields (except tower shields).

\textbf{Spellcasting}: At every even-numbered level gained in the chasseur's class, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class in which they could cast 2nd-level spells before they added the prestige class. They do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of chasseur to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class he has, and then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before he became a chasseur, he must decide to which class he adds each level of chasseur for the purpose of determining spells per day.

\textbf{Urban Tracking}: At 1st level, a chasseur gains \feat{Urban Tracking} as a bonus feat.

\textbf{Mage-Hunter}: At 1st level, a chasseur can add his class level to \skill{Diplomacy} checks, as long as his arcane spellcasting remains hidden. When dealing with other arcane spellcasters or when his arcane spellcasting is revealed he adds his class level as penalty to \skill{Diplomacy} checks.

\textbf{Cry Witch (Ex)}: At 1st level, a chasseur can incite the common people against a target once a week. He must show his insignia and loudly accuse the target of wizardry. All common folk and local guard will try to seize and restrain the target by all means necessary. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect.

The first time a chasseur cries witch in a community, the local folk believes blindly in his word. After the first time, the local folk makes a special DC 20 Will save. The DC decreases by 2 for each cry beyond the first. The DC decreases by 5 for each person falsely accused. Treat the listeners as a single entity with a +15 Will save for this effect.

He gains another weekly use for every two levels beyond the 1st.

\textbf{Blind-Fight}: At 2nd level, a chasseur gains \feat{Blind-Fight} as a bonus feat.

\textbf{Improved Counterspell (Su)}: At 2nd level a chasseur gains the ability to better use arcane spells to counterspell enemy mages. When counterspelling, instead of using the exact spell a chasseur is trying to counter, he may use a spell of the same school that is one or more levels higher than the target spell.

\textbf{Anti-mage Spellcasting (Su)}: At 3rd level, a chasseur adds his class level to the DC of any arcane spell he casts that target another arcane spellcaster. This does not apply to spells that do not have target, or spells that target creatures other than arcane spellcasters.

\textbf{Immediate Counterspell}: Beginning at 4th level, a chasseur may use a immediate action to counter a spell, instead of preparing an action for it. Countering spells still follow the same rules, and the chasseur can use this ability with \emph{improved counterspell}.

\textbf{Armored Mage}: At 5th level, a chasseur ignores arcane spell failure chances when wearing light armor.
