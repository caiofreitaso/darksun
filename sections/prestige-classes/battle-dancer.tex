\PrestigeClass{Battle Dancer}
{Death to our enemies. Death to the ones who have wronged us.}{Santhaal Wind Dancer, elven chieftain}
{Battle dancers are elven clerics devoted to perfecting the union of body and clerical magic. They are warriors following the call of one element, and use their powers to defend their tribe. Battle dancers are looked upon with awe from fellow tribe members, and they often become champions for their tribes. Battle dancers are proud of their warrior prowess and dedication to elven traditions as well as their devotion to their element of worship.}

{Battle dancers are always of elven blood. The vast majority are full-blooded elves, but occasionally a tribal half-elf aspires to the status of battle dancer. Battle dancers are single- or multi-classed clerics. Multi-classed clerics often take rogue or fighter levels to diversify their abilities or further augment their combat abilities.}

\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies:} Battle dancers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons. Battle dancers are proficient with light armor, but not shields.

\textbf{Spellcasting:} When a new battle dancer level is gained---except 1st and every four levels thereafter (5th and 9th)---the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever divine spellcasting class in which they could cast 2nd-level spells before they added the prestige class. They do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of battle dancer to the level of whatever other divine spellcasting class he has, and then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If he had more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a battle dancer, he must decide to which class he adds each level of battle dancer for the purpose of determining spells per day.

\textbf{Bardic Knowledge:} A battle dancer collects the odd bits of lore and knowledge that bards acquire. He can add his battle dancer class level to his bardic knowledge checks, so his bardic knowledge checks have a bonus equal to his bard level + his battle dancer level + his Int modifier.

\textbf{Bardic Music:} Battle dancer levels stack with bard levels for the purpose of determining the battle dancer's daily uses of his bardic music abilities (if any) and the bardic musics inspire courage, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics. For example, a 4th-level bard/3rd-level water cleric/5th-level battle dancer could use bardic music nine times per day, his inspire courage ability would grant a +2 morale bonus on the appropriate rolls, and he would be able to inspire greatness.

He gains each inspire ability as a bard of the same level, if he does not have bard levels. For example, a 2nd-level rogue/3rd-level fire cleric/8th-level battle dancer could use bardic music nine times per day, and his inspire courage ability would grant +2 morale bonus on the appropriate rolls.

\textbf{Battle Dance (Ex):}

\textbf{Two-Weapon Fighting:} At 2nd level, a battle dancer gains \feat{Two-Weapon Fighting} as a bonus feat.

\textbf{Ambidexterity (Ex):} At 5th level, a battle dancer lessen the penalties for fighting with two weapons by 1 (from $-4$ to $-3$, or from $-2$ to $-1$ if the off-hand weapon is a light weapon). At 9th level, the penalties are lessened by another 1 (from $-3$ to $-2$, or from $-1$ to $+0$ if the off-hand weapon is a light weapon).

\textit{Elemental Dance (Sp):} At 7th level, a battle dancer may expend two daily turn or rebuke slots to infuse his weapons with elemental power for one minute, as the \spell{elemental weapon} spell. His caster level is equal to his class level.
