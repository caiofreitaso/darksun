\PrestigeClass{Battle Dancer}
{Death to our enemies. Death to the ones who have wronged us.}{Santhaal Wind Dancer, elven chieftain}
{A battle dancer is basically a specialized ritual dancer, one who uses his or her talents not to tell stories but to defend the tribe. In elf tribes, those who decide to combine the skills of the warrior arts with priestly endeavors become battle dancers.

In times of peace, they use their skills of dance and ritual storytelling to inspire their tribes and to help their elemental singers administer to the spiritual well-being of the elves under their care. When combat opportunities present themselves, the battle dancers welcome them. They feel closest to their chosen elements when combining warrior skills and clerical magic into a deadly dance of violence.}

{Battle dancers are always of elven blood. The vast majority are full-blooded elves, but occasionally a tribal half-elf aspires to the status of battle dancer. Battle dancers are single- or multi-classed clerics. Multi-classed clerics often take rogue or fighter levels to diversify their abilities or further augment their combat abilities.}

\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies:} Battle dancers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons. Battle dancers are proficient with light armor, but not shields.

\textbf{Spellcasting:} When a new battle dancer level is gained---except 1st and every four levels thereafter (5th and 9th)---the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever divine spellcasting class in which he could cast 2nd-level spells before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of battle dancer to the level of whatever other divine spellcasting class he has, and then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If he had more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a battle dancer, he must decide to which class he adds each level of battle dancer for the purpose of determining spells per day.

\textbf{Bardic Music:} Battle dancer levels stack with bard levels for the purpose of determining the battle dancer's daily uses of his bardic music abilities (if any) and the bardic musics inspire courage, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics. For example, a 4th-level bard/3rd-level water cleric/5th-level battle dancer could use bardic music nine times per day, his inspire courage ability would grant a +2 morale bonus on the appropriate rolls, and he would be able to inspire greatness.

He gains each inspire ability as a bard of the same level, if he does not have bard levels. For example, a 2nd-level rogue/3rd-level fire cleric/8th-level battle dancer could use bardic music nine times per day, and his inspire courage ability would grant +2 morale bonus on the appropriate rolls.

The battle dancer also expands his repertoire of bardic music to improve his combat skills. Each use of a battle dancer dance expends one daily use of the character's bardic music ability.

\textit{Battle Dance (Su):} A battle dancer of 2nd level or higher with 10 or more ranks in \skill{Perform} (dance) can enter in a battle dance. The battle dance lasts a number of rounds equal to half of his ranks in \skill{Perform} (dance), rounded down. The battle dancer gains +1 insight bonus on his AC, attack and damage rolls. While in this state, the battle dancer can use his bardic music as a swift action. At every four levels beyond the 2nd, this bonus increases by +1 (+2 at 6th, and +3 at 10th).

\textit{Dance of Elemental Glory (Su):} A battle dancer of 7th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in \skill{Perform} (dance) can call upon their elemental patrons for inspiration. He can prepare to cast a divine spell by adding his dance technique to the somatic components of the spell. This dance is used with the casting and increases the time to cast the spell, in order to adjust the somatic components. Spells that take an immediate action to cast cannot be improved this way. Spells prepared with \feat{Quicken Spell}, or cast as a swift action with dance of elemental haste, are treated as having an original casting time of a swift action.

\Table{}{XX}{
\tableheader Original Casting Time & \tableheader New Casting Time\\
1 swift action & 1 move action \\
1 standard action & 1 full round \\
1 full round or longer & Double the time \\
}

The next spell he casts gains a bonus to its caster level based on the result of the battle dancer's \skill{Perform} (dance) check:

\Table{}{XC}{
\tableheader Perform Check Result & \tableheader Caster Level Increase\\
9 or lower & +0 \\
10 to 19 & +1 \\
20 to 29 & +2 \\
30 to 39 & +3 \\
40 to 49 & +4 \\
50 or higher & +5 \\
}

\textbf{Movement Mastery (Ex):} A battle dancer is so certain of his movements that he is unaffected by adverse conditions. When making a \skill{Jump}, \skill{Perform} (dance), or \skill{Tumble} check, he may take 10 even if stress and distraction would normally prevent him from doing so.

\textbf{Two-Weapon Fighting:} At 2nd level, a battle dancer gains \feat{Two-Weapon Fighting} as a bonus feat.

\textbf{Swift Inspiration (Su):} At 4th level, a battle dancer can expend one turn or rebuke undead daily attempt to cast a divine spell that has a personal range as a swift action, if he is under the effect of battle dance, inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics.

\textbf{Ambidexterity (Ex):} At 5th level, a battle dancer lessen the penalties for fighting with two weapons by 1 (from $-4$ to $-3$, or from $-2$ to $-1$ if the off-hand weapon is a light weapon). At 9th level, the penalties are lessened by another 1 (from $-3$ to $-2$, or from $-1$ to $+0$ if the off-hand weapon is a light weapon).
