\PrestigeClass{Earth Defender}
{Arrogant aristocrats, witless farmers and vile defilers---they are all the same. They are my enemies, for they bring death to the fading life I have sworn to protect. Woe to these parasites if they cross my path!}{Nuan, human earth defender}
{Earth defenders are preservers concerned with protecting the environment at all costs. Some earth defenders choose to protect an area of land, while others devote their efforts to protect a species. The earth defender's charge is called a ward, and she is prepared to go to almost any length to protect it. Many earth defenders are fanatics. Their hatred against defilers or anything else that could harm their ward can be extreme. Death is the most usual punishment for threatening the earth defender's ward. Earth defenders can draw power from Spirits of the Land to smite their foes and get help from nature's creatures.}

Earth defenders are single or multi-classed preserver wizards. Ranger/earth defenders often range across long distances, protecting members of endangered species wherever they journey. Druid/earth defenders, especially those who are grove masters, tend to guard a specific area.

Earth defenders are sworn enemies of defilers. NPC earth defenders are usually encountered protecting their chosen wards.

\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiencies}: Earth defenders are proficient with all simple  weapons, plus the handaxe, tortoise blade, atlatl, and shortbow. Earth defenders are proficient with light armor, but not shields.

\textbf{Skirmish (Ex)}: An earth defender relies on mobility to deal extra damage and improve her defense. She deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all attacks she makes during any round in which she moves at least 3 meters. The extra damage applies only to attacks taken during the earth defender's turn. This extra damage increases by 1d6 for every four levels gained above 1st (2d6 at 5th, 3d6 at 9th level).

The extra damage only applies against living creatures that have a discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are not vulnerable to this additional damage. The earth defender must be able to see the target well eough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Scouts can apply this extra damage to ranged attacks made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within 9 meters.

At 3rd level, an earth defender gains a +1 competence bonus to Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 3 meters. The bonus applies as soon as the earth defender has moved 3 meters, and lasts until the start of her next turn. This bonus improves by 1 for every four levels gained above 3rd (+2 at 7th level).

An earth defender loses this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. If she gains the skirmish ability from another class, the bonuses stack.

\textbf{Ward}:

\textbf{Trackless Step (Ex):} Starting at 2nd level, an earth defender leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.

\textbf{Camouflage (Ex)}: Beginning at 4th level, an earth defender can use the \skill{Hide} skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment. She loses this benefit when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

\textbf{Nature's Ally (Ex)}: Beginning at 4th level, Spirits of the Land recognize the earth defender's dedication to nature and awards her. The earth defender adds all \emph{summon nature's ally} spells to her spell list, and she can use her spell slots to prepare \emph{summon nature's ally} spells. She does not need a spellbook to prepare these spells.

\textbf{Evasion (Ex):} At 6th level, an earth defender can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the earth defender is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless earth defender does not gain the benefit of evasion.

\textbf{Armored Mage (Ex)}: At 7th level, an earth defender ignores arcane spell failure chances when wearing light armor.

\textbf{Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):} While in any sort of natural terrain, an earth defender of 8th level or higher can use the \skill{Hide} skill even while being observed.
