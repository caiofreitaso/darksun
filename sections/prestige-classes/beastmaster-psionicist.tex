\PrestigeClass{Beastmaster Psionicist}
{Come here, little guy. Come. Let me see what you're thinking.}{Hormandar, elf beastmaster psionicist}
{The beastmaster is a psionicist with an affinity for animals of all kinds. He can calm a raging mekillot with a few soothing words, or turn the most loyal guard creatures to his side. He is an outsider who is more comfortable with his animal charges than with any humanoid companionship.

Most beastmasters are not natives of the cities, but instead come from small villages or nomadic tribes---a background in which the young psionicist has extensive experience and contact with the animals he understands so well.}

{Beastmasters tend to be multi-classed psions, with levels on either druid or ranger---they share the love of the natural beasts with these classes.}

\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:} Beastmaster psionicists gain proficiency in all simple weapons, plus bolas, lasso, net, and whip. Beastmaster psionicists are proficient with light and medium armors, but not shields.

\textbf{Manifesting:} At every odd-numbered level, a beastmaster psionicist gains additional power points per day and access to new powers as if he had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of beastmaster psionicist to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.

If a character had more than one manifesting class before he became a beastmaster psionicist, he must decide to which class he adds the new level of beastmaster psionicist for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.

\textbf{Animal Companion (Ex):} A beastmaster psionicist gains the service of a loyal animal companion. See the ranger class feature. Treat the beastmaster psionicist as a ranger whose level is equal to the beastmaster psionicist's class level + 6. A beastmaster psionicist can select one of the animals available to a 4th-level ranger and then apply the modifications as appropriate for a 7th-level ranger's animal companion, or he can select a typical version of one of the animals available to a 7th-level ranger.

As a beastmaster psionicist gains class levels, his animal companion gains Hit Dice and other special abilities just as a ranger's animal companion does. Use the beastmaster psionicist's class level + 6 to determine the animal companion's special abilities.

If a beastmaster psionicist already has an animal companion from another class, his beastmaster psionicist class levels stack with class levels from all other classes that grant an animal companion. For example, a 4th-level ranger/4th-level psion/2nd-level beastmaster psionicist would be treated as a 12th-level ranger for the purpose of improving the statistics of his animal companion (and which alternative animal companions he could select).

\textbf{Wild Empathy (Ex):} A beastmaster psionicist can improve the attitude of an animal. See the druid class feature. If the beastmaster psionicist has wild empathy from another class, his levels stack for determining the bonus.

\textbf{Beast Telepathy (Su):} At 2nd level, a beastmaster psionicist may add \onehalf his class level to any telepathy power check, when manifesting powers to affect animals, magical beasts, and vermins.

\textbf{Psi-Companion (Su):} At 2nd level, a beastmaster psionicist becomes psionically linked with his animal companion. He can have any power he manifests on himself also affect his animal companion. The animal companion must be within 1.5 meter of him at the time of the manifestation to receive the benefit. If the power has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the animal companion if it moves farther than 1.5 meter away, and will not affect the animal companion again, even if it returns to its owner before the duration expires.

Additionally, the beastmaster psionicist can manifest a power with a target of ``You'' on his animal companion (as a touch range power) instead of on himself. The owner and animal companion cannot share powers if the powers normally do not affect creatures of the animal companion's type (animal).

At 4th level, a beastmaster psionicist may manifest telepathic powers targeting his animal companion without spending power points or making power checks. This applies only when the animal companion is the single target of the psionic power. He must still pay the maintenance cost.

At 6th level, a beastmaster psionicist can use his animal companion as the point of origin for a telepathy power. The animal companion must be within 6 meters of him at the time of the manifestation, and within line of sight.

At 8th level, a beastmaster psionicist has a telepathic link with his animal companion out to a distance of up to 1.5 kilometer. The owner cannot see through the animal companion's senses, but the two of them can communicate telepathically as if the animal companion were the target of a \psionic{mindlink} power manifested by the owner. For instance, an animal companion placed in a distant room could relay the activities occurring in that room.

Because of the telepathic link between an animal companion and its owner, the owner has the same connection to an item or place that the animal companion does. For instance, if his animal companion has seen a room, the owner can \spell{teleport} into that room as if he has seen it too.

\textbf{Track:} At 3rd level, a beastmaster psionicist gains \feat{Track} as a bonus feat.

\textbf{Uncanny Dodge (Ex):} Starting at 3rd level, a beastmaster psionicist retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)

If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).

\textbf{Wasteland Sense (Ex):} At 5th level, a beastmaster psionicist can add his Constitution bonus (if any) as natural armor bonus on his Armor Class, and on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and natural hazards. He loses this bonus when he is wearing heavy armor or tower shields, when immobilized or helpless, or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

\textbf{Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):} At 7th level, a beastmaster psionicist can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the beastmaster psionicist. The exception to this defense is that a thief at least four levels higher than the beastmaster psionicist can flank him (and thus sneak attack him).

If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum thief level required to flank the character.

\textbf{Swift Tracker (Ex):} Beginning at 9th level, a beastmaster psionicist can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal $-5$ penalty. He takes only a $-10$ penalty (instead of the normal $-20$) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

\textbf{Practiced Telepath (Su):} At 10th level, a beastmaster psionicist may take 10 when making power checks to manifest telepathy powers.
