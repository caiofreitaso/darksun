\PrestigeClass{Horizon Walker}
{Been there, done that.}{Alahna, horizon walker}
{Horizon walkers are ever-travelers, adventuring to the most interesting places in Athas---and beyond. These travels make them adapt to any environment they find themselves, but also more distant as nothing can truly impress them.}

{Rangers are predominately the class that makes the ranks of horizon walkers. But air clerics, bards, even barbarians and rogues occasionally adopt the prestige class. The one thing all have in common is their lust for new places.

\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:} Horizon walkers gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

\textbf{Terrain Mastery:} At each level, the Horizon Walker adds a new terrain environment to their repertoire from those given below. Terrain mastery gives a horizon walker a bonus on checks involving a skill useful in that terrain, or some other appropriate benefit. A horizon walker also knows how to fight dangerous creatures typically found in that terrain, gaining a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures with that terrain mentioned in the Environment entry of their descriptions. The horizon walker only gains the bonus if the creature description specifically lists the terrain type.

Horizon walkers take their terrain mastery with them wherever they go. They retain their terrain mastery bonuses on skill checks, attack rolls, and damage rolls whether they're actually in the relevant terrain or not.

\textbf{Planar Terrain Mastery:} Planar terrain mastery functions just like terrain mastery, except that the horizon walker can choose one of the planar categories at each level. The horizon walker can take a non-planar terrain type instead, if she wishes.

\subsubsection{Terrain Mastery Benefits}

\textbf{Boulder Fields:} You are in constant alert. You do not need to sleep.

\textbf{Forest:} You gain camouflage. You can use the \skill{Hide} skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.

\textbf{Rocky badlands:} Your body adapted to the harsh environment and poor hunt. You do not need to eat.

\textbf{Salt Flats:} You resist effects that tire you. You are immune to fatigue, and anything that would cause you to become exhausted makes you fatigued instead.

\textbf{Scrub Plains:} You gain woodland stride. You may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect you.

\textbf{Sea of Silt:} You resist effects of heat. You treat temperatures up to extreme heat (from 65°C to 82°C) as if it was moderate heat.

\textbf{Stony Barrens:} You do not need to drink.

\textbf{Verdant Plains:} Your land speed is faster than the norm for your race by +3 meters. This benefit applies only when you are wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying your speed because of any load carried or armor worn.

\textbf{Underground:} You have 18-meter darkvision, or 36-meter darkvision if you already had darkvision from another source.
