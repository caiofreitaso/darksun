{Gladiators make up the majority of arena champions, since their abilities already so closely mimic those of the prestige class. Most of the rest are fighters, along with the occasional psychic warrior or barbarian with a knack for flare and extravagance.}

\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:} Arena champions gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

\textbf{Gladiatorial Performance:} Gladiator levels stack with arena champion levels for the purpose of determining gladiatorial performance special abilities.

\textbf{Crowd Support (Ex):} The crowd may love or loathe an arena champion, but regardless their presence is motivating. An arena champion enjoys a +1 morale bonus to attack and damage rolls whenever there are ten or more non-combatant spectators present. At 5th and 9th level this bonus increases, but the minimum amount of spectators must be fifty and one hundred respectively for the bonuses to take effect.

\textbf{Reputation:} At 2nd level, an arena champion receives a +1 circumstance bonus to non-combat uses of the \skill{Bluff}, \skill{Diplomacy}, \skill{Gather Information} and \skill{Intimidate} skills. These benefits do not apply when dealing with the devoted fans of rival gladiators. If the arena champion has the \feat{Leadership} feat, he gets a +1 bonus to his leadership score.

These bonuses increase to +2 at 6th level, and to +3 at 10th level.

\textbf{Weapon Mastery:} At 3rd level, an arena champion gets a +2 bonus to damage rolls with a chosen weapon. The weapon must be one for which he already has selected the \feat{Weapon Focus} feat.

\textbf{Signature Move (Ex):} Arena champions develop a signature move at 4th level. The exact technical nature of the move is up to the individual arena champion to develop, and it grants one of the following benefits:
\begin{itemize*}
\item A +2 competence bonus on opposed rolls for disarm attempts.
\item A +2 competence bonus on opposed rolls for trip attempts.
\item A +2 competence bonus on damage rolls for sunder attempts.
\item A +2 competence bonus on opposed Bluff and Sense Motive checks in combat.
\item A +1 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively or using total defense.
\end{itemize*}

\textbf{Improved Signature Move (Ex):} At 7th level, the benefit associated with the arena champion's chosen signature move is doubled. For example, a +2 competence bonus on opposed rolls for disarm attempts increases to +4.

Alternatively, he may select a second signature move instead to expand his repertoire.

\textbf{Roar of the Crowd (Ex):} At 8th level, he can use the cheering of the crowd to your advantage. In any round when he successfully deals damage to an opponent, he gains a +1 morale bonus on the next attack roll he makes in the same round.

\textbf{Legend:} At 10th level, an arena champion becomes a legend known to all. Treat general NPC initial attitudes as one category better. This benefit does not extend to the devoted fans of rival gladiators.

\textbf{Finishing Move (Ex):} At 10th level, if an attack reduces an opponent below 0 hit points, you can attempt a coup de grace as a free action.

% {Not every arena champion is a pompous gladiator---some of them are also raging barbarians or powerful fighters. They simply want the prestige and fame the profession brings.}
% {Characters who achieve this level of success can learn important details about specific arena champions in your campaign, including a notable individual, the area in which he operates, and the kinds of activities he undertakes.}

% Because arena champions have great reputations and a vast number of fans, the easiest way to find one is to contact the local arena manager or gladiatorial match agent and inquire about individuals with unique fighting talents.
