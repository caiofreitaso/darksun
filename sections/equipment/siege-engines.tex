\section{Siege Engines}
Siege engines are large weapons, temporary structures, or pieces of equipment traditionally used in besieging a castle or fortress.

\textbf{Catapult, Heavy:} A heavy catapult is a massive engine capable of throwing rocks or heavy objects with great force. Because the catapult throws its payload in a high arc, it can hit squares out of its line of sight. To fire a heavy catapult, the crew chief makes a special check against DC 15 using only his base attack bonus, Intelligence modifier, range increment penalty, and the appropriate modifiers from the lower section of \tabref{Catapult Attack Modifiers}. If the check succeeds, the catapult stone hits the square the catapult was aimed at, dealing the indicated damage to any object or character in the square. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save take half damage. Once a catapult stone hits a square, subsequent shots hit the same square unless the catapult is reaimed or the wind changes direction or speed.

If a catapult stone misses, roll 1d8 to determine where it lands. This determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 being back toward the catapult and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the target square. Then, count 3 squares away from the target square for every range increment of the attack.

Loading a catapult requires a series of full-round actions. It takes a DC 15 Strength check to winch the throwing arm down; most catapults have wheels to allow up to two crew members to use the aid another action, assisting the main winch operator. A DC 15 \skill{Profession} (siege engineer) check latches the arm into place, and then another DC 15 \skill{Profession} (siege engineer) check loads the catapult ammunition. It takes four full-round actions to reaim a heavy catapult (multiple crew members can perform these full-round actions in the same round, so it would take a crew of four only 1 round to reaim the catapult).

A heavy catapult takes up a space 4.5 meters across.

\textbf{Catapult, Light:} This is a smaller, lighter version of the heavy catapult. It functions as the heavy catapult, except that it takes a DC 10 Strength check to winch the arm into place, and only two full-round actions are required to reaim the catapult.

A light catapult takes up a space 3 meters across.

\textbf{Ballista:} A ballista is essentially a Huge heavy crossbow fixed in place. Its size makes it hard for most creatures to aim it. Thus, a Medium creature takes a $-4$ penalty on attack rolls when using a ballista, and a Small creature takes a $-6$ penalty. It takes a creature smaller than Large two full-round actions to reload the ballista after firing.

A ballista takes up a space 1.5 meter across.

\textbf{Mekillot Ram:} This 15-meter war machine has a live mekillot encased within a twelve-wheeled car. The structure has an upper and central deck, with a 3-meter spiked ram at the front, a rear tower, and a heavy catapult on the upper deck. The ram section has reinforced chitin plates, while the ram itself is carved to a point. It can hold up to 64 soldiers, 24 soldiers on the upper deck and 40 in the central deck. These rams also have harness for 40 slaves to help push the vehicle.

In order to make the equivalent of a swing of a ram, the mekillot must take a standard action to charge against the AC of the construction, moving up to 6 meters, and applying disadvantage for the lack of proficiency. In addition to the damage given on \tabref{Siege Engines}, each slave helping push the ram adds their Strength modifier to the ram's damage.

The ram requires a crew chief, two drivers to tend the mekillot, a lookout, and the four-person crew for the heavy catapult. Drivers use psionic or magical means to contact the lookout to steer the vehicle. The mekillot cannot be removed from the ram, and must be fed and watered within its shell.

A mekillot ram takes up a 15-meter-by-7.5-meter space. The mekillot can push the ram at a speed of 6 meters (and a mekillot ram can't run). With the 40 slaves helping push the vehicle, they increase the vehicle's speed to 12 meters (it still can't run). This is usually only done in battle, and the mekillot carries the ram alone during travel.

\textbf{Ram:} This heavy pole is sometimes suspended from a movable scaffold that allows the crew to swing it back and forth against objects. As a full-round action, the character closest to the front of the ram makes an attack roll against the AC of the construction, applying disadvantage for lack of proficiency. (It's not possible to be proficient with this device.) In addition to the damage given on \tabref{Siege Engines}, up to nine other characters holding the ram can add their Strength modifier to the ram's damage, if they devote an attack action to doing so. It takes at least one Huge or larger creature, two Large creatures, four Medium-size creatures, or eight Small creatures to swing a ram. (Tiny or smaller creatures can't use a ram.)

A ram is typically 9 meters long. In a battle, the creatures wielding the ram stand in two adjacent columns of equal length, with the ram between them.

\textbf{Siege Tower:} This device is a massive wooden tower on wheels or rollers that can be rolled up against a wall to allow attackers to scale the tower and thus to get to the top of the wall with cover. The wooden walls are usually 30 centimeters thick.

A typical siege tower takes up a space 4.5 meters across. The creatures inside push it at a speed of 3 meters (and a siege tower can't run). The eight creatures pushing on the ground floor have total cover, and those on higher floors get improved cover and can fire through arrow slits.
