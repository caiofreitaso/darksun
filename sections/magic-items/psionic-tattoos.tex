\subsectionA{Psionic Tattoos}
Psionic tattoos are designs scribed on the skin that manifest powers on their wearers. The wearer doesn't get to make any decisions about the tattoo's effect---the manifester who scribed it has already done so. The tattoo's effect is continuous.

Psionic tattoos do not use the normal body slots for magic items, they use what available space there is in your body. Psionic tattoos can vary in size based on its manifester level, and a creature can hold a total of 137 manifester levels.

\textbf{Physical Description:} A typical psionic tattoo is a colorful pattern of tiny, interlacing lines within a larger design. This design can be as simple as a circle or a star, or as complex as an artist wishes to make it. Once it is scribed, a tattoo's design does not change. The size of the tattoo indicates its manifester level.

\textbf{Scribing Tattoos:} The manifester level of a psionic tattoo is the minimum level required to manifest the scribed power.

% \textit{Tattoo Location:} Different areas of the body can hold varying number of manifester levels, depending on their size (see \tabref{Psionic Tattoo Areas}). A psionic tattoo that requires more manifester levels than an area can hold, it can be scribed into an adjacent area. For example, an augmented \psionic{offensive precognition} with 13th manifester level can be tattooed in one whole arm---hand, forearm and upper arm.

Attempting to add one more total manifester levels than the maximum allowed in any area causes all previously scribed tattoos in your body to simultaneously resonate and explode, each tattoo dealing 1d10 per manifester level. All tattoos are lost when this happens.

& Foot        & 2 each & \\
}

\textbf{Suppressing a Tattoo Effect:} A psionically tattooed character can suppress any tattoo effect with a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The character must use one action for each tattoo. Reactivating a tattoo is another standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

\subsubsection{Cursed Psionic Tattoos}
The most common psionic tattoos provide useful improvements to the tattooed character. On the other hand, cursed psionic tattoos provide persistent harmful effects. While those powers usually require the character to fail in a saving throw, a cursed psionic tattoo does not. A character with a cursed tattoo is under the effect of the psionic power as if she had failed the saving throw.

Removing a cursed psionic tattoo requires manifesting \psionic{bend reality} or \psionic{reality revision} from a character with higher manifester level than the tattooist.

Here is a brief description of each cursed psionic tattoo---for a detailed description of each psionic power, see \chapref{Powers}.
