\subsectionA{Wands}
A wand is a thin baton that contains a single spell of 4th level or lower. Each wand has 50 charges when created, and each charge expended allows the user to use the wand's spell one time. A wand that runs out of charges is just a stick.

\textbf{Physical Description:} A typical wand is 15 centimeters to 30 centimeters long and about 60 milimeters thick, and often weighs no more than 30 grams. Most wands are wood, but some are bone. A rare few are metal, glass, or even ceramic, but these are quite exotic. Occasionally, a wand has a gem or some device at its tip, and most are decorated with carvings or runes. A typical wand has AC 7, 5 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 16.

\textbf{Activation:} Wands use the spell trigger activation method, so casting a spell from a wand is usually a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the spell being cast, however, has a longer casting time than 1 standard action, it takes that long to cast the spell from a wand.) To activate a wand, a character must hold it in hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for nonhumanoid creatures) and point it in the general direction of the target or area. A wand may be used while grappling or while swallowed whole.

\subsubsection{Wand Descriptions}
All wands are simply storage devices for spells and thus have no special descriptions. Refer to the spell descriptions for all pertinent details.
