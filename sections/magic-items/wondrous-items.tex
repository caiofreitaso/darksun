\subsectionA{Wondrous Items}
This is a catch-all category for anything that doesnâ€™t fall into the other groups. Anyone can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description).

\textbf{Physical Description:} Varies.

\textbf{Activation:} Usually use-activated or command word, but details vary from item to item.

\textbf{Special Qualities:} Roll d\%. An 01 result indicates the wondrous item is intelligent, 02--31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32--100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes.

Wondrous items with charges can never be intelligent.
