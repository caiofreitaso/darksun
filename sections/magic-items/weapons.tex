\section{Weapons}
Magic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses to both attack and damage rolls when used in combat. All magic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonus on attack rolls does not stack with their enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonus applies to either type of attack.

In addition to an enhancement bonus, weapons may have special abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses (except where specifically noted). A single weapon cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

A weapon or a kind of ammunition may be made of an unusual material. Roll d\%: 01--95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96--100 indicates that it is made of a special material.

\textbf{Caster Level for Weapons:} The caster level of a weapon with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus and no other abilities, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.

\textbf{Additional Damage Dice:} Some magic weapons deal additional dice of damage. Unlike other modifiers to damage, additional dice of damage are not multiplied when the attacker scores a critical hit.

\textbf{Ranged Weapons and Ammunition:} The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the two enhancement bonuses applies.

Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already have).

\textbf{Magic Ammunition and Breakage:} When a magic arrow, crossbow bolt, shuriken, or sling bullet misses its target, there is a 50\% chance it breaks or otherwise is rendered useless. A magic arrow, bolt, bullet, or shuriken that hits is destroyed.

\textbf{Light Generation:} Fully 30\% of magic weapons shed light equivalent to a light spell (bright light in a 6-meter radius, shadowy light in a 12-meter radius). These glowing weapons are quite obviously magical. Such a weapon can't be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Some of the specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.

\textbf{Hardness and Hit Points:} Each +1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to a weapon's or shield's hardness and +10 to its hit points.

\textbf{Activation:} Usually a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon---by attacking with it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate then the user usually needs to utter a command word (a standard action).

\textbf{Magic Weapons and Critical Hits:} Some weapon qualities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit. This special effect functions against creatures not subject to critical hits, such as undead, elementals, and constructs. When fighting against such creatures, roll for critical hits as you would against humanoids or any other creature subject to critical hits. On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon's regular damage.

\textbf{Weapons for Unusually Sized Creatures:} The cost of weapons for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium varies. The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.

\textbf{Special Qualities:} Roll d\%. If the item is a melee weapon, a 01--30 result indicates that the item sheds light, 31--45 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon's function, and 46--100 indicates no special qualities.

If the item is a ranged weapon, a 01--15 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon's function, and 16--100 indicates no special qualities.
