\section{Transitive Planes}
Transitive Planes are the planes that connect the Prime Material Plane (Athas) to the Outer and Inner Planes. They are the glue that holds the cosmology together. These planes are used for safe or fast travel, to reach areas that might be more difficult to access otherwise. All are mostly empty; most of the space within is used only to access other planes. Permanent structures within Transitive Planes are tied tightly to their coexistent or coterminous planes. Finally, and most important, these planes can all be entered or manipulated by magic, so they have an important place in a spellcaster's bag of tricks.

Denizens of a Transitive Plane usually come from the planes connected to it, but a Transitive Plane can have its own native life. Creatures found on a Transitive Plane may be visitors, or they may have carved out their own domains within the empty space of the plane.
