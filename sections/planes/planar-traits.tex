\section{Planar Traits}
Each plane of existence has its own properties---the natural laws of its universe.

Planar traits are broken down into a number of general areas.

All planes have the following kinds of traits.

\textbf{Physical Traits:} These traits determine the laws of physics and nature on the plane, including how gravity and time function.

\textbf{Elemental and Energy Traits:} These traits determine the dominance of particular elemental or energy forces.

\textbf{Alignment Traits:} Just as characters may be lawful neutral or chaotic good, many planes are tied to a particular moral or ethical outlook.

\textbf{Magic Traits:} Magic works differently from plane to plane, and magic traits set the boundaries for what it can and can't do.
