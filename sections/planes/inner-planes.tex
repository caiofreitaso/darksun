\section{Inner Planes}
The Inner Planes are places of raw power and pure elements, of ultimate states and extreme conditions. They are the building blocks of the rest of the universe and represent matter and energy in their primal states. As destinations go, the Inner Planes are the most inhospitable to creatures from the Material Plane. Unprepared travelers are at best helpless before such power, and at worst they are snuffed out like candles in a tornado.

Each of the Inner Planes is a region of roughly similar environment. The Elemental Plane of Earth, for example, is mostly solid matter, while flames overwhelm the Elemental Plane of Fire. On each of the planes are bits of other elements and substances, existing like islands in the otherwise overwhelming element or energy. Outsiders and visitors gravitate toward the comfort these islands provide. The City of Brass, on the Elemental Plane of Fire, is the best-known locale of this type.
