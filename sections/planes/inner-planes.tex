\section{Inner Planes}
The Inner Planes are places of raw power and pure elements, of ultimate states and extreme conditions. They are the building blocks of the rest of the universe and represent matter and energy in their primal states. As destinations go, the Inner Planes are the most inhospitable to creatures from the Material Plane. Unprepared travelers are at best helpless before such power, and at worst they are snuffed out like candles in a tornado.

Each of the Inner Planes is a region of roughly similar environment. The Elemental Plane of Earth, for example, is mostly solid matter, while flames overwhelm the Elemental Plane of Fire. On each of the planes are bits of other elements and substances, existing like islands in the otherwise overwhelming element or energy. Outsiders and visitors gravitate toward the comfort these islands provide. The City of Brass, on the Elemental Plane of Fire, is the best-known locale of this type.

The Inner Planes have the following structure.

The Plane of Elemental Air is coterminous with the Paraelemental Planes of Rain and Sun.

The Plane of Elemental Earth is coterminous with the Paraelemental Planes of Magma and Silt.

The Plane of Elemental Fire is coterminous with the Paraelemental Planes of Magma and Sun.

The Plane of Elemental Water is coterminous with the Paraelemental Planes of Rain and Silt.

The Plane of Positive Energy and The Plane of Negative energy are separate from all other Inner Planes.
