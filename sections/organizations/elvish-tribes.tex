\section{Elvish Tribes}

% \textbf{Entry Requirements:} Must be an elf; or pass 

Elvish tribes are notoriously nomads, typically running as a group towards new grounds to hunt, trade, or raid. Outsiders often view their culture as savage and barbaric. They don't use any type of mount, as elves reject the idea of depending on others for transportation. The tribe takes care of one as long as they can keep up with the tribe, otherwise they are left behind.
