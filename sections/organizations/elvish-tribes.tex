\section{Elvish Tribes}

\textbf{Entry Requirements:} Must be an elf.

Elvish tribes are notoriously nomads, typically running as a group towards new grounds to hunt, trade, or raid. Outsiders often view their culture as savage and barbaric. They don't use any type of mount, as elves reject the idea of depending on others for transportation. The tribe takes care of one as long as they can keep up with the tribe, otherwise they are left behind.

\subsubsection{Elvish Tribes Benefits}
\textbf{Economics:} Elvish merchants are willing to go one step lower when bargaining (see \skill{Diplomacy}) when selling goods to fellow tribe members.

\textbf{Services:} With the exception of basic needs, services are always paid and tribe members do not get a discount. All elvish tribes have access to merchants, scouts, and thieves. Some tribes may have access to more specific experts.

\textbf{Information:} All tribes excel with their information network, since they are nomads with very little military power. Being a member of the tribe gives access to part of these secrets. Elvish sages have a \skill{Knowledge} modifier of +15, or a \skill{Gather Information} modifier of +20.

\textbf{Access:} Most tribes are nomads, so tribe members will always have protection and every basic need covered while traveling with the tribe.

\subsubsection{Elvish Tribes in the Game}
There are two major types of elvish tribes: minor merchant houses and herdsmen. Minor merchant houses might hire the PCs for protection, but they do not have the wealth required for riskier tasks. Their main quests are spying on other houses. Herdsmen interact mostly with the natural dangers of the wasteland and the occasional merchant house with which they trade livestock and its derivatives.

There are exceptions for these types: the Silver Hands who control a fixed settlement, and the Shadows who are mostly assassins for hire.
