\textbf{Entry Requirements:} Must have a power point reserve of at least 1 power point.

Hundreds of psionic organizations are scattered throughout the Tyr region. Each city hosts schools of all sizes, Villichi communities lie hidden in the deserts, and ancient brotherhoods unite masters from across the land. Overshadowing all of these is \textbf{the Order}, a group so secret that few know of its existence.

\subsubsection{Psionic Schools Benefits}
Being a member of any psionic school gives access to some common benefits. Some schools grant access to specific prestige classes.

\textbf{Information:} Whenever the PCs find themselves in one of the schools headquarters, they have free access to a researcher with \skill{Knowledge} (psionics) +15 or \skill{Knowledge} (any other category) +10. Given two weeks' time, a more learned sage (+20 in psionics and +15 in other categories) can respond to telepathic requests.
