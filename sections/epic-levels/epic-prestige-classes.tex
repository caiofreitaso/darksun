\section{Epic Prestige Classes}
This chapter presents prestige classes that support epic Athasian characters. Prestige classes described here include the Athasian dragon, capable of using plant life and living creatures to power their spells; the avangion, capable of using magic without harming any source; the element lord, the ultimate elemental champion; the spirit initiate, capable of melding with a spirit of the land; the Order adept, psionic defendants of the natural order.

If you are interested in a prestige class, examine its entry requirements carefully. Most of the classes in this book have stringent requirements that demand enormous effort from their characters and early planning in order to be fulfilled. The prestige classes found in this chapter are described below in broad terms that can help you narrow your choices.
