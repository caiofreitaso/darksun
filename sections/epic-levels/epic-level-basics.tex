\section{Epic Level Basics}
Epic characters---those whose character level is 21st or higher---are handled slightly differently from nonepic characters. While epic characters continue to receive most of the benefits of gaining levels, some benefits are replaced by alternative gains. A class can be advanced beyond 20th level. A ten-level prestige class can progress beyond 10th level, but only if the character level is already 20th or higher. A class with fewer than ten levels cannot progress beyond the maximum for that class, regardless of character level.

If your group is using the traditional leveling system via XP, you can use \tabref{Traditional Experience and Wealth}. In this table there is the expected wealth of player characters. Use this as a guide to balance adventures, i.e., do not assume a 23rd-level character should have a 762,000 cp item.

\subsection{Adding a Second Class}
When a single-class epic character gains a level, they may choose to increase the level of their current class or pick up a new class at 1st level. The standard rules for multiclass characters still apply.
