    You enchant the air inside an airtight container, effectively stopping time inside it. Items inside do not age or decay. If the container is broken, the items are unharmed and resume aging normally.

    You may choose to fix a single spell effect to the container. The spell effect is unleashed on any creature that tampers with the container. Spell effects that may be tied to a \emph{air of permanence} include \spell{bestow curse}, \spell{blindness/deafness}, \spell{contagion}, \spell{harm}, and \spell{poison}. Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. (See individual spell descriptions for details.)

    Once the container is broken and the spell is lost, the spell effect is also lost.

    This container must cost at least 1,000 cp.
