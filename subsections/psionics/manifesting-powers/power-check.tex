\subsection{Power Check}
You must make a special ability check to manifest your chosen power:

\begin{Formula}{1d20 + \textit{key ability score} -- \textit{power level}\\(DC 20)}
\end{Formula}

\textit{Note:} The check adds the ability score, not the ability modifier.

The key ability depends on the discipline of the power being manifested. See \tabref{Disciplines and Associated Abilities}.

\Table{Disciplines and Associated Abilities}{XX}{
\tableheader Discipline & \tableheader Associated Ability \\
Psychometabolism & Constitution \\
Psychoportation  & Constitution \\
Psychokinesis    & Intelligence \\
Metacreativity   & Intelligence \\
Clairscience     & Wisdom \\
Telepathy        & Wisdom \\
Universal        & Wisdom \\
}

\textbf{Failure:} If you fail your power check, you lose half of the power points without manifesting the power.
