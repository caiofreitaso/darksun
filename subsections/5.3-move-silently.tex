\Skill{Move Silently}{Dex; Armor Check Penalty}
\textbf{Check:} Your Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of anyone who might hear you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your full speed, you take a $-5$ penalty. It's practically impossible ($-20$ penalty) to move silently while running or charging.

Noisy surfaces, such as bogs or undergrowth, are tough to move silently across. When you try to sneak across such a surface, you take a penalty on your Move Silently check as indicated below.

\Table{}{L c}{

Very noisy (dense undergrowth, deep snow) & $-5$
}

\textbf{Action:} None. A Move Silently check is included in your movement or other activity, so it is part of another action.

\textbf{Special:} The master of a cat familiar gains a +3 bonus on Move Silently checks.

A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Move Silently checks.
