\subsectionA{The Ethereal Plane}
The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is coexistent and coterminous with the Gray and the Inner Planes. Since the Gray does not form a large buffer between the Material Plane and the Ethereal, it allows the Ethereal Plane to act as a bridge between the Inner Planes and the Material Plane via elemental conduits. These conduits provide the energy source for clerics and druids.

While on the Ethereal Plane, creatures can see the Material Plane via the Gray, which acts as a dirty lens. The Material Plane appears without colors because of the Gray, and its forms blurring into each other, barely recognizable. The visibility on the Ethereal Plane is greatly reduced, creatures can only see in a 3-meter radius.

While it is possible to see into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Border, the Ethereal Border is invisible to those on the Material Plane. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Border cannot attack creatures on the Material Plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Border is invisible, incorporeal, and utterly silent to someone on the Material Plane.

The Ethereal Plane is mostly empty of structures and impediments. Only planar travelers inhabit the plane, and mostly for a short period.
In the Ethereal Plane, movement becomes abstract as the plane has no landmarks, so the concepts of distance or direction lose meaning. Only time matters, as locations are closer to states of being rather than physical constants.

\textbf{Curtains of Vaporous Color:} These stationary curtains bridge the Ethereal Plane to the Inner Planes as one-way portals. Well-known color curtains may be guarded, worshiped, or exploited by those with interest in the plane on the other end. Each plane gives the curtains a unique color and intensity.

\textbf{Elemental Conduits:} Elemental conduits are thin vortices barely visible through the ethereal mist that connect one of the elemental or paraelemental planes directly to Athas. They flex and weave as they move through the Ethereal Plane, and successfully catching one of them is akin to hitching a ride on a tornado. Grabbing a conduit requires a successful Will save (DC 20). Failure means the individual is flung violently away from the conduit and takes 1d10 points of damage from the elemental turbulence. Success indicates that the traveler has latched onto the conduit and moves instantly onto one of the two planes the conduit connects. Conduits tend to flow either in one direction or the other, but they do not change their direction of flow frequently, so individuals who hitch a ride on a conduit in quick succession wind up on the same plane.

The advantage of using a conduit is that the traveler likely has a way back out of the destination plane. The disadvantage is that it's impossible to tell by looking where a conduit is coming from or where it's going. Conduits are often used by ethereal travelers who have no other means of transportation and need to get off the Ethereal Plane quickly.

\textbf{Elemental Tornados:} Elemental conduits may become unstable and generate dangerous weather on the Ethereal Plane. Any character in close proximity with an elemental tornado must succeed on a Will save (DC 30) or be sucked toward the tornado. Anyone in contact with the funnel cloud is picked and whirled around for 1d10 rounds, taking energy damage per round, before being expelled. The nature of the damage depends on the elemental plane from which the tornado came.

The Ethereal Plane has the following traits.
\begin{itemize*}
\item \textbf{No gravity.}
\item \textbf{Alterable morphic.} The plane contains little to alter, however.
\item \textbf{Mildly neutral-aligned.}
\item \textbf{Normal magic:} Spells function normally on the Ethereal Plane, though they do not cross into the Material Plane.
\end{itemize*}
