\subsectionA{Elemental Plane of Air}
The Elemental Plane of Air is an empty plane, consisting of sky above and sky below. Clouds billow up in bank after bank, swelling into grand thunderheads and dissipating into wisps like cotton candy. The wind pulls and tugs around the traveler, and rainbows glimmer in the distance.

The Elemental Plane of Air is the most comfortable and survivable of the Inner Planes, and it is the home of all manner of airborne creatures. Indeed, flying creatures find themselves at a great advantage on this plane. While travelers without flight can survive easily here, they are at a disadvantage.

Cities in the Elemental Plane of Air are vast floating fortresses composed of clouds and walls of wind. While non-natives will find these disorienting and weird, denizens of the plane have little trouble navigating the streets of these floating cities.

Armies of Air are strange indeed. While many air elementals are naturally invisible, elemental beasts and incarnations soar within the ranks. They may seem like smaller numbers than are actually there by sight, but the Armies of Air make a fearsome and terrible noise as they approach. If traveling on the plane, one should flee from the sound of great rushing wind, and thunderclaps that have no clouds or lightning.

The Elemental Plane of Air has the following traits.
\begin{itemize*}
\item \textbf{Subjective Directional Gravity:} Inhabitants of the plane determine their own ``down'' direction. Objects not under the motive force of others do not move.
\item \textbf{Air-Dominant.}
\item \textbf{Enhanced Magic:} Spells and spell-like abilities that use, manipulate, or create air (including spells of the Air domain) are both empowered and enlarged (as if the \feat{Empower Spell} and \feat{Enlarge Spell} metamagic feats had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots).
\item \textbf{Impeded Magic:} Spells and spell-like abilities that use or create earth (including spells of the Earth domain and spells that summon earth elementals or outsiders with the earth subtype) are impeded.
\end{itemize*}
