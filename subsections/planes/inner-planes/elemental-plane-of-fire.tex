\subsectionA{Elemental Plane of Fire}
The Elemental Plane of Fire is a nightmare to behold. The ground is nothing more than great, ever shifting plates of compressed flame. The air ripples with the heat of continual firestorms. The oceans are made of liquid flame. Yet, many creatures call this place home. Non-natives who lack protection from fire will find themselves nothing more than cinders within minutes if not seconds.

Fire burns here without fuel or air, and flammables brought onto the plane are ignited and consumed. The cities of this plane are constructed of compressed flames and heavy metals, like brass. The Lords of Fire are some of the most volatile, yet weakest rulers of the Elemental Planes. Their passion burns like everything else and they change their minds in a flash. Beware the traveler who makes a deal with the Lords of Flames as the contract may go up in smoke.

Armies of Fire are masked by the rolling smoke that heralds their approach, and they radiate heat that will burn those that come too close. Travelers on the plane should flee if they encounter a war party, as Fire delights in setting those unburned alight.

The Elemental Plane of Fire has the following traits.
\begin{itemize*}
\item \textbf{Fire-Dominant:} Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost immediately, and those wearing unprotected flammable clothing catch on fire. In addition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire damage every round. Those that are made of water take double damage each round.
\item \textbf{Enhanced Magic:} Spells and spell-like abilities  with the fire descriptor are both maximized and enlarged (as if the \feat{Maximize Spell} and \feat{Enlarge Spell} had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized or enlarged are unaffected by this benefit.
\item \textbf{Impeded Magic:} Spells and spell-like abilities that use or create water (including spells of the Water domain and spells that summon water elementals or outsiders with the water subtype) are impeded.
\end{itemize*}
