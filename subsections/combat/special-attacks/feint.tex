\subsection{Feint}
Feinting is a standard action. To feint, make a \skill{Bluff} check opposed by a \skill{Sense Motive} check by your target. The target may add his base attack bonus to this \skill{Sense Motive} check. If your \skill{Bluff} check result exceeds your target's \skill{Sense Motive} check result, the next melee attack you make against the target does not allow him to use his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). This attack must be made on or before your next turn.

When feinting in this way against a creature of a different shape than yours, you get disadvantage on your roll. For example, an elf would get disadvantage on her \skill{Bluff} check to feint a thri-kreen, since she is humanoid and he is a insectoid. At the same time, he would roll with disadvantage if he tries to feint the elf.

Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2), you take a $-8$ penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it's impossible.

Feinting in combat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

\textbf{Feinting as a Move Action:} With the \feat{Improved Feint} feat, you can attempt a feint as a move action instead of as a standard action.
