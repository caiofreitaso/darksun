\subsection{Tactical Movement}
The characteristics of moving in a combat situation: distance to be covered, the possible impediments, and special rules are described below.

\subsubsection{Measuring Distance}
\textbf{Diagonals:} When measuring distance, the first diagonal counts as 1 square, the second counts as 2 squares, the third counts as 1, the fourth as 2, and so on.

You can't move diagonally past a corner (even by taking a 1.5-meter step). You can move diagonally past a creature, even an opponent.

You can also move diagonally past other impassable obstacles, such as pits.

\textbf{Closest Creature:} When it's important to determine the closest square or creature to a location, if two squares or creatures are equally close, randomly determine which one counts as closest by rolling a die.
