\subsection{Speed}
Your speed tells you how far you can move in a round and still do something, such as attack or cast a spell. Your speed depends mostly on your race and what armor you're wearing.

Aarakocras, dwarves, and halflings have a speed of 6 meters (4 squares), or 4.5 meters (3 squares) when wearing medium or heavy armor (except for dwarves, who move 6 meters in any armor).

Humans, half-elves, muls, and pterrans have a speed of 9 meters (6 squares), or 6 meters (4 squares) in medium or heavy armor.

Elves, half-giants, and thri-kreen have a speed of 12 meters (8 squares), or 9 meters (6 squares) in medium or heavy armor.

If you use two move actions in a round (sometimes called a ``double move'' action), you can move up to double your speed. If you spend the entire round to run all out, you can move up to quadruple your speed (or triple if you are in heavy armor).
