\TableNote{2}{1 Regardless of the action, if you move out of a threatened square, you usually provoke an attack of opportunity. This column indicates whether the action itself, not moving, provokes an attack of opportunity.}\\
\TableNote{2}{2 If you aid someone performing an action that would normally provoke an attack of opportunity, then the act of aiding another provokes an attack of opportunity as well.}\\
\TableNote{2}{3 If the object is being held, carried, or worn by a creature, yes. If not, no.}\\

\subsubsection{Suppressing Psionic Tattoo}
You can suppress and reactivate a psionic tattoo as a standard action. Suppressing or activating psionic tattoos provoke attacks of opportunity. The character must use one standard action for each tattoo.

\subsubsection{Total Defense}
You can defend yourself as a standard action. You get a +4 dodge bonus to your AC for 1 round. Your AC improves at the start of this action. You can't combine total defense with fighting defensively or with the benefit of the \feat{Combat Expertise} feat (since both of those require you to declare an attack or full attack). You can't make attacks of opportunity while using total defense.

\subsubsection{Start/Complete Full-Round Action}
The ``start full-round action'' standard action lets you start undertaking a full-round action, which you can complete in the following round by using another standard action. You can't use this action to start or complete a full attack, charge, run, or withdraw.
