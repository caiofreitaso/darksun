\TableNote{2}{1 Regardless of the action, if you move out of a threatened square, you usually provoke an attack of opportunity. This column indicates whether the action itself, not moving, provokes an attack of opportunity.}\\
\TableNote{2}{2 May be taken as a standard action if you are limited to taking only a single action in a round.}\\
}

A full-round action requires an entire round to complete. Thus, it can't be coupled with a standard or a move action, though if it does not involve moving any distance, you can take a 1.5-meter step.

\subsubsection{Use Special Ability}
Using a special ability is usually a standard action, but some may be full-round actions, as defined by the ability.

\subsubsection{Move 1.5 meter through Difficult Terrain}
In some situations, your movement may be so hampered that you don't have sufficient speed even to move 1.5 meter (a single square). In such a case, you may spend a full-round action to move 1.5 meter (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. Even though this looks like a 1.5-meter step, it's not, and thus it provokes attacks of opportunity normally.
