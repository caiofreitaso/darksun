\subsubsection{Activate Magic Item}
Many magic items don't need to be activated. However, certain magic items need to be activated, especially potions, scrolls, wands, rods, and staffs. Activating a magic item is a standard action (unless the item description indicates otherwise).

\textbf{Spell Completion Items:} Activating a spell completion item is the equivalent of casting a spell. It requires concentration and provokes attacks of opportunity. You lose the spell if your concentration is broken, and you can attempt to activate the item while on the defensive, as with casting a spell.

\textbf{Spell Trigger, Command Word, or Use-Activated Items:} Activating any of these kinds of items does not require concentration and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
