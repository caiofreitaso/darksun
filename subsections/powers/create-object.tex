	You can assemble matter from air and the surrounding area to create a solid object. This object remains in existence as long as you pay the power's maintenance cost. When you stop maintaining it, the object breaks into its constituent parts. An object created this way can have any shape, color, and texture you desire, provided it fulfills at least one of the following conditions:
	\begin{enumerate*}
	\item The object must have a volume up to 0.9 m$^3$;
	\item The object must weigh up to 5 kg;
	\item Only available materials within range can be used in the construction.
	\end{enumerate*}

	However, these materials can be rearranged or restructured if you also know \psionic{molecular rearrangement}. By combining these two powers, you could manufacture diamonds from coal dust or a sword from rocks containing iron ore. You must succeed on an appropriate skill check to make a complex item.
