	You can feel the presence of water. You detect all greater than Tiny that have moisture, plus any concentration of one gallon or more. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you search a particular area.

	\textit{1st Round:} Presence or absence of moisture in the area.

	\textit{2nd Round:} Amount of moisture in the area.

	\textit{3rd Round:} The location of each individual with moisture present and all others sources of moisture. If a moisture concentration is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

	The power can penetrate barriers, but 30 centimeters of stone, 2.5 centimeters of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 1 meter of wood blocks it. Note that dirt does not block the power.

	\textit{Augment:} For every additional power point you spend, this power's range increases by 15 meters, up to 90 meters.
