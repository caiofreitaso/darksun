	As the \spell{commune} spell, except as noted here.

	You contact the spirits and can gather knowledge from them.	You must ask very specific questions when using this power; the spirits will never volunteer information and often seek to distort or confuse the truth. The spirits possess a lot of knowledge about a lot of different things and matters, but they are not omniscient. To determine the quality of the information received, roll a d\% and check the following table:

	\Table{}{cL}{
	\tableheader d\% & \tableheader Result \\
	01--70  & The spirit knows the answer to the question and answers truthfully \\
	71--80  & The spirit knows the answer, but tries to disguise the truth in deceptive riddles \\
	81--90  & The spirit doesn't know, but admits its ignorance \\
	91--100 & The spirit knows only part of the answer and embellishes the truth \\
	}
