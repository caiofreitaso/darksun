	\emph{Thought shield} protects you from telepathic attacks for one round, clouding your mind so as to hide first one part, then another.

	This power imposes a modifier to the power check of any telepathic attack that targets you. This modifier depends on the telepathic attack that is being used, and are described below. This power does not grant any bonus or penalty in your saving throw against any telepathic attack.

	\Table{}{XC}{
	  \tableheader Telepathic Attack
	& \tableheader Power Check Modifier \\
	\psionic{Ego Whip}       &  +0  \\
	\psionic{Id Insinuation} &  +2  \\
	\psionic{Mind Thrust}    & $-3$ \\
	\psionic{Psionic Blast}  &  +3  \\
	\psionic{Psychic Crush}  & $-3$ \\
	}

	You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Manifesting the power is an immediate action. You can use this power even when it's not your turn.
