{
	You control magnetism to accumulate a charge of static electricity and discharge it in the form of violent electrical shocks. Discharging is a ranged touch attack, and the target loses their Dexterity on their AC for this attack. You gain +3 bonus on your attack roll if the opponent is wearing metal armor (or made out of metal, carrying a lot of metal, or the like). You deal 2d6 points of electricity damage per round of accumulation. To accumulate charge, you need only to maintain the power.

	Once discharged, you still can accumulate charge by maintaining the power, without needing to manifest \emph{static discharge} for a second attack.
