	You create a kinetic battery that stores all physical impact damage in a potential field around your body. While you maintain this power, you are immune to all physical weapons. A sword slash stops instantly when it touches your skin, arrows drop harmlessly at your feet, and monsters' talons and fangs can't harm you. You absorb the damage of the blow and saves it for later use.

	You store half of any damage you would have taken from a physical weapon. You can release this potential damage with a touch attack, or with a melee attack. If you hit with a melee weapon, you add the absorbed damage to your normal melee damage. Missed attacks do not release potential damage.

	\emph{Kinetic control} does not stop damage from falling, grapple, constrict, touch attacks (such as a shadow's Strength drain), or area effects (like \spell{fireball} or \spell{static discharge}).

	If you cease to maintain \emph{kinetic control} while you still have energy to dissipate, the potential field collapses and you receive double the stored damage.
