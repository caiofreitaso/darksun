    You overwhelm and damage nearby psyches. After psionically grumbling for one full round, your consciousness burst forth and a psychic scream penetrates all minds within 15 meters.

    All intelligent minds within 15 meters become unconscious for 1d3 hours unless they succeed on a Fortitude save. Psionic characters who failed the save lose all psionic power. Only a \psionic{psychic chirurgery}, \psionic{bend reality}, \psionic{reality revision}, \spell{miracle}, or \spell{wish} can revert this loss.

    This power is devastating but also risky for the manifester. If you fail the power check, you become unconscious for 1d10 days.
