{
	This power is a special variation of \psionic{psionic telekinesis}. Instead of moving any object relatively slowly, \emph{ballistic attack} allows the character to hurl a small object at a target. The object, no more than 0.5 kilograms in weight, can achieve deadly speeds. It must be within sight and cannot be anchored or attached to anything else. A rock is the most common weapon.

	You must succeed on a ranged attack roll to hit the target, applying your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier. Hurled weapons deal their standard damage (your Strength bonus does not apply; arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects deal 1d6 points of damage.
