	You can change the magnetic orientation of a metal object. The \emph{magnetized} object attracts all unattended metal objects lighter than itself in a 6 meters radius, and the \emph{magnetized} object will be attracted to the heaviest metal object within the same radius. For example, a \emph{magnetized} metal short sword would attract nearby gold pieces toward itself and the sword would be attracted to a metal armor.

	Magical or attended metal objects lighter than the target object must succeed in a Reflex save, or be attracted to it. Creatures wearing metal armor must succeed a Fortitude save or become immobilized.

	When sharp \emph{magnetized} metal objects are attracted to a character wearing metal armor, they attack with an attack bonus of +20 and $-1$ penalty per 1.5 meter of distance, and deal bonus damage equal to +4 per 3 meters of distance.

	\textit{Augment:} For every 5 additional power points, the maximum weight you can affect is increased by 1 kg.
