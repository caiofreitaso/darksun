	You alter the target's metabolism to cure wounds or diseases. Any wound can be healed, but only nonmagical diseases can be removed (this power cannot remove mummy rot).

	Every turn you maintain \emph{cell adjustment} you may choose one (and only one) of the following options:
	\begin{itemize*}
		\item \textit{Heal wounds:} You may spend additional power points to heal up to 4 hit points of damage. Every hit point healed requires 5 power points.

		\item \textit{Remove disease:} You may spend additional 5 power points and attempt to remove one single disease affecting the target with a successful power check. Failure means the disease is too widespread and you may try again next round.
	\end{itemize*}
