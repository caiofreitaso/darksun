	You can weaken the substance of an object or structure. You can affect both mundane and magical inanimate material. Weakening an object's substance decreases its hardness. You can decrease an object's hardness by 1 per round.

	Using weapons weakened have a $-1$ penalty on attack and damage rolls per point of hardness lost. Weakened armor lose 1 Armor Class bonus per point of hardness lost.

	When hardness reaches 0, weapons become rubbery and may break easily. Armor can be dented with soft blows. Stone can be worked like stiff clay. Wood can be punched through, even the hardest and thickest doors.

	\emph{Soften} has no effect on living tissue.
