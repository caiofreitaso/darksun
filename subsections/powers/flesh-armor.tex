	You transform your own skin into armor. No one can see the change, but it's as if you had actually acquired some type of armor. The type of armor your body mimics depends on the result of your power check, as shown in the following table:

	\Table{}{lCc}{
	  \tableheader Result
	& \tableheader Armor
	& \tableheader Armor Bonus \\
	DC    & Padded          & +1 \\
	DC +1 & Leather         & +2 \\
	DC +2 & Studded leather & +3 \\
	DC +4 & Scale mail      & +4 \\
	DC +5 & Breastplate     & +5 \\
	DC +7 & Splint mail     & +6 \\
	DC +8 & Half-plate      & +7 \\
	DC +9 & Full plate      & +8 \\
	}

	Because this armor is part of his body, you can enjoy its benefits without suffering any penalty you might have if you were actually wearing that type of armor. The armor created by this power weighs nothing, has no magnetic properties, and in no way encumbers you.
