	When you learn \emph{animal affinity}, you must select one creature to which you develop affinity. This creature must have one of the following types: animal, magical beast, or vermin. This creature can't be two or more size categories larger or smaller than you. You cannot select any creature that has a template.

	Whenever you manifest \emph{animal affinity}, your eyes change shape to that of your affinity and you gain low-light vision. You also undergo a physical change that allows you to gain one of that creature's characteristics:

	\begin{itemize*}
	\item One type of movement speed,
	\item Natural armor bonus,
	\item One natural attack,
	\item One extraordinary special ability,
	\item One physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution).
	\end{itemize*}

	You can only gain one characteristic per manifestation of \emph{animal affinity}. To switch to a different characteristic, you need a new manifestation for it.
