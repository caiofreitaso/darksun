	This power lets you get a sensory image of the present surroundings of a particular unliving item. You need not have any idea where the object is when the power is used, but you must concentrate on a specific, familiar item. For instance, ``my friend Krasha's metal dagger'' is fine, but ``the nearest metal dagger'' is not.

	You receive an all-round sensory ``snapshot'' from the item's surroundings: visual, olfactory, aural, and temperature signals. The power itself gives no notion of direction or distance to the item in question, though the character can often deduce its location from the sensory signals.

	If the item has been destroyed before the power is used, the power check automatically fails. A concealed item (for example, in a pocket) gives a black visual image and insignificant olfactory, aural, and temperature signals.
