	\emph{Mental barrier} protects you from telepathic attacks for 2 rounds, by building a wall of thought repetition that exposes only one small area of the mind at a time.

	This power imposes a modifier to the power check of any telepathic attack that targets you. This modifier depends on the telepathic attack that is being used, and are described below. This power does not grant any bonus or penalty in your saving throw against any telepathic attack.
