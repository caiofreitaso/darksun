	You drain a target of its momentum, stopping its motion. The stolen momentum is dissipated harmlessly in the ground at your feet. These are the main uses of this power:
	\begin{enumerate*}
		\item \textit{Stop moving creature:} Walking or fighting creatures must make a successful Reflex save or lose their action and become dazed until their next round.

		\item \textit{Stop running or charging creature:} Running or charging creatures become stunned until their next round and must make a successful Reflex save with $-4$ penalty or fall prone.

		\item \textit{Reduce falling damage:} When used on a falling creature, the creature loses all of their speed and the falling damage is considered for the distance after their momentum was neutralized.

		\item \textit{Stop flying missile:} Arrows, crossbow bolts, catapult missiles are halted in mid-air and begin to fall.
	\end{enumerate*}

	Creatures flying through natural means start falling after their momentum is lost, but they can regain stability in their next round as a move action, provided they are still in the air.
