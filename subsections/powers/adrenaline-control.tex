{
	By controlling the production and release of adrenaline in your system, you can give yourself temporary physical boosts on demand. When you manifest this power you gain 1d6 points, which you can add directly to your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution scores as alchemical bonuses however you choose. You enjoy all the normal bonuses for high physical attributes while this power is in effect.

	If your power check result is exactly equal to the DC of the check, you overtax your system with this adrenaline. You still get the boost, but you lose twice that many hit points, too.
