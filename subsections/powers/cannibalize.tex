	You gain the abilty to trade your Constitution score for more power points. For each point of Constitution you lose, you gain 10 power points. This score decrease is treated as a special form of ability damage, called ability burn, which cannot be magically or psionically healed---it goes away only through natural healing.

	You can burn your Constitution score by an amount equal to your manifester level (or any lesser amount), assuming you can afford to burn it to such an extent.

	When this power expires, your power point boost also ends, but your ability burn remains until it is healed naturally.
