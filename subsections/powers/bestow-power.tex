	You link your mind with another psionic creature's mind, creating a brief conduit through which mental energy can be shared. When you manifest this power, the subject gains up to 8 power points. You can transfer only as many power points to a subject as it has manifester levels.

	Because of the intimate nature of this power, it cannot be fabricated into a psionic item---only power points generated by a psionic creature in the moment can be shared using \emph{bestow power}.

	\textit{Augment:} For every 10 additional power points you spend, the subject gains 8 additional power points.
