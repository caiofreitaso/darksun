{
	You send a telepathic message to the target's mind. There are two possible effects:
	\begin{itemize*}
		\item You send a telepathic message of up to ten words. \emph{Send thoughts} is strictly a one-way exchange from you to the subject. If you do not share a common language, the subject ``hears'' meaningless mental syllables. This effect does not allow saving throw.
		\item You distract the subject. On a failed Will save, the target gains --2 on all attack rolls, and if the target is a spellcaster, they must succeed on a \skill{Concentration} check to cast any spell.
	\end{itemize*}

	\textit{Augment:} For every 5 additional power points you spend, this power's save DC and power check DC increase by 1.
