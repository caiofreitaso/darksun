	You can create sound from silence and control existing sounds. The volume of sound created, however, depends on your power check (see the table below). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise produced can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire lion is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

	\Table{}{CC}{
	  \tableheader Volume
	& \tableheader Power Check DC \\
	 4 humans & 12 \\
	 8 humans & 13 \\
	12 humans & 14 \\
	16 humans & 15 \\
	20 humans & 16+ \\
	}

	Once the sound is created, you can control it without expending the power point cost for \psionic{control sound} (but still paying the normal maintenance cost).
