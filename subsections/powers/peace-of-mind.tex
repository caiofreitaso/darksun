	\emph{Peace of mind} is an almost instinctual psionic defense. You can still recover power points while maintaining this power.

	This power imposes a modifier to the power check of any telepathic attack that targets you. This modifier depends on the telepathic attack that is being used, and are described below. This power does not grant any bonus or penalty in your saving throw against any telepathic attack.

	\Table{}{XC}{
	  \tableheader Telepathic Attack
	& \tableheader Power Check Modifier \\
	\psionic{Ego Whip}       &  +2  \\
	\psionic{Id Insinuation} & $-5$ \\
	\psionic{Mind Thrust}    &  +2  \\
	\psionic{Psionic Blast}  &  +0  \\
	\psionic{Psychic Crush}  &  +0  \\
	}

	You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Manifesting the power is an immediate action. You can use this power even when it's not your turn.
