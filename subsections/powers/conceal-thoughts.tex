	You create a dome of protection against any spell or power that reads or detects thoughts (such as \spell{detect thoughts}, \psionic{detect life}, or \psionic{read thoughts}).

	In order to manifest any psionic power to detect or read anyone inside the protected area, the creature must win a psychic contest against you.

	Any spell automatically fails to read or detect anyone protected by the area.
