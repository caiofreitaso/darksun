    When you manifest this power, you must choose which type of trance to enter.

    \begin{itemize*}
    \item \textit{Martial Trance:} When you enter into a martial trance, you focus on improving your physical skills in detriment of your psionic abilities. You gain +1 insight bonus to your Armor Class, attack rolls, and on all saving throws. You have disadvantage on all power checks, as well.
    \item \textit{Psionic Trance:} You focus your complete attention on your psionic activity, and tune out all other distractions. You gain +1 insight bonus on power checks related to a specific discipline, chosen during manifestation. You have $-1$ penalty on your Armor Class and disadvantage on skill checks, except \skill{Concentration}.
    \end{itemize*}

    \textit{Augment:} For every 5 additional power points you spend, the insight bonus gained and the power check DC both increase by 1.
