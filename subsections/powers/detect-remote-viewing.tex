	You gain an sixth sense to determine whenever you are being observed. Whenever a character is actively using \skill{Spot} checks on you or whenever there is an attempt to observe you by any scrying effect, you may roll a power check. A successful check does not reveal the location of the watcher, it only confirms your suspicions that you are being watched.

	If the observer is using a psionic power to monitor you, you may attempt a psionic contest to obscure their scrying. If you win the contest, the observer can't use any scrying psionic power on you for 1d4 hours.
