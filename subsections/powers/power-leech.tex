	As \psionic{thieving mindlink}, except that you gain the capacity to drain the subject of power points while this power is active.

	Draining the subject's power points is a separate standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. If that attack succeeds, you drain the subject of 3d4 power points and adding 3 of those points to your reserve (unless that gain would cause you to exceed your maximum).
