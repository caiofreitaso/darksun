	Your brow erupts with an arc of crackling dark energy that connects with your \emph{contacted} foe, draining it of 5d4 power points and adding 5 of those points to your reserve (unless that gain would cause you to exceed your maximum).

	The drain continues in each round you maintain \emph{power leech} while the subject of the drain remains in range. If the subject is drained to 0 power points, this power ends.

	Maintaining \emph{power leech} is a full-round action (you can take no other actions aside from a 1.5-meter step) instead of a free action.
