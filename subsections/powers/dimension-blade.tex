	You can your control of dimensions to make one weapon into an infinitely sharp blade by making it two-dimensional. Almost any weapon can be altered this way, except jointed, chain, or rope weapons (such as whips, flails, or nunchuks).

	While you maintain this power, melee attacks with the affected weapon are resolved as melee touch attacks.

	The \emph{dimension blade} can also be used to cleanly cut objects, such as a stone pillar, or the axle of a wagon. When sundering weapons or attacking objects, the \emph{blade} bypass any hardness.
