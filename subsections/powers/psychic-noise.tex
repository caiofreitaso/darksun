	You create synaptic static that interferes with all psionic activity within the power area. When you manifest \emph{psychic noise}, you can't manifest any other power.

	Anyone else within the area must spend double the amount of power points to maintain any active psionic power. To manifest psionic powers, the creature must win a psychic contest against you.

	Exposure to the psychic noise for more than 5 minutes will leave anyone sickened for the same amount of time as the exposure. %give anyone a splitting headache.
	
	You can increase the range of this psychic field, but it gets more difficult with each range step.
