    You tamper with the laws of chance to affect a specific action. You gain advantage in your next roll, if it's made in the next minute. This applies to attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, or ability checks.

    This advantage can also apply to a d\% roll---you roll two d\% and choose the best value. You can manipulate probabilities for arcane spell failure, or concealment miss chance.

    You can't use this for power check rolls.
