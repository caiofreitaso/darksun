	\emph{Psychic crush} is a massive assault upon all neurons in the brain, attempting to destroy all by a massive overload of signals.

	As a telepathic attack, \emph{psychic crush} has the following characteristics:
	\begin{itemize*}
		\item Will saving throw DC equal to 10 + \textit{manifester level}. Only psionic creatures can resist attempts of partial \psionic{contact}.
		\item You can attack the same target twice with a single manifestation. This requires two different power checks and two different saving throws (if applicable).
	\end{itemize*}

	\textbf{Contact:} If the target's mind has already been \emph{contacted}, \emph{psychic crush} deals 2d8 points of damage. This effect does not allow for a saving throw.

	\textit{Augment:} For every 2 additional power points you spend, you increase the DC by 1. You can only spend a maximum of 8 additional power points this way.
