{
	Used as an area attack, \emph{detonate} deals 2d12 damage to unattended objects in 3-meter radius spread, ignoring hardness. This can be enough to destroy cloth, paper, ropes, and objects of more fragile materials. This use can be made against a large object or structure, destroying no more than 0.25 m$^3$ of material.

	You can use \emph{detonate} to completely destroy a single construct or undead creature. The target must have a physical body. A target that makes a successful Reflex save is partially affected, taking 2d12 points of damage that ignore any damage reduction.
