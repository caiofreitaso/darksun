	You can learn details of an inanimate object's previous owner. Objects accumulate psychic impressions left by their previous owners, which can be read by use of this power.

	The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular object. You can maintain this power for one additional minute per point above the power check DC on your power check. You may stop maintaining this power before you reach your time limit.

	\textit{1st Minute:} Last owner's race.

	\textit{2nd Minute:} Last owner's gender.

	\textit{3rd Minute:} Last owner's age.

	\textit{4th Minute:} Last owner's alignment.

	\textit{5th Minute:} How last owner gained and lost the object.

	\textit{6th+ Minute:} Next-to-last owner's race, and so on.

	An object can be read only once per character level---additional reading at that level reveal no additional information. When you gain a new character level, you can try reading the same object again, even if your power score has not changed.
