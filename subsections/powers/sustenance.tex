	You can go without food and water for one day. Each time you manifest this power, your body manufactures sufficient solid and liquid nourishment to satisfy your needs for that time.

	You can survive in this fashion for a number of days equal to your level or five days, whichever is more. If you reach your limit, you collapse from exhaustion. You must rest one day for every two days spent sublimating your body's needs.

	\textit{Augment:} For every 10 additional power points you spend, you may target another creature with a touch. Those creatures have the same limitations as you.
