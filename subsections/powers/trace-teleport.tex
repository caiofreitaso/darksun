	You sense the use of any effects of psionic or magical teleportation within the area. You sense the use of these powers whether or not you have line of sight or line of effect (although a force effect prevents this detection). You can trace the destination of any psionic or magical teleportation made by others within this power's area within the last minute.

	You know the direction and distance the individuals traveled and could \spell{teleport} to the location yourself if you so desired (and if you know the \psionic{psionic teleport} power or can cast the \spell{teleport} spell), as if you had ``seen casually'' the location. This power does not grant you any information on the conditions at the other end of the trace beyond the mental coordinates of the location.

	\textit{Augment:} If you spend 20 additional power points, this power's range increases to 36 meters.
