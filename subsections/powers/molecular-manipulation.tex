	You create a ``breaking point'' in an object or structure. You can affect both mundane and magical inanimate material. This breaking point decreases its hit points. This is not damage to the object, the maximum hit points are decreased in the same way as reducing Constitution of a living creature.

	You can decrease an object's hit points by 2 per round. If an object reaches 0 hit points, it breaks. If an object has a bigger volume than 0.03 m$^3$, then you need to work with each cube of 0.03 m$^3$ separately.

	Keep in mind that an object need not be in two pieces before it's virtually useless. For example, a little boat with a cracked hull is unsafe at sea, and a weakened cart wheel may not support the full weight it once did.

	\textbf{Working Manipulated Metals:} An object or portion thereof whose hit points is decreased is permanently changed. You can also weaken a preforged weapon, a suit of armor, or some other finished item.
