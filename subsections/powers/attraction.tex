{
	You implant into the subject's mind an overwhelming desire to a particular thing---it can be an item, creature, action, or event. The subject does whatever seems reasonable to get close to their \emph{attraction}.

	The subject is still able to recognize dangers, so they won't leap into a fire or over a cliff, for example. However, they won't flee unless the threat is strong and immediate.

	The power does not enable you to control the \emph{attracted} character. It only implants the \emph{attraction}, while the subject's mind is still their own.
