	You can perceive surface or active thoughts of a \emph{contacted} mind. You cannot use \emph{read thoughts} to explore someone's memories or delve into their subconscious.

	Most intelligent creatures tend to think in words, so language is a barrier to understanding.  Creatures of animal intelligence have simple, instinctual thoughts that you can pick up, since they think in pictures. Magical thought, such as a wizard uses in casting spells, is unintelligible.  However, you can easily recognize such thoughts as part of the spellcasting process. If you read the thoughts of a creature with an Intelligence of 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence score), you are stunned for 1 round and the power ends.

	This power does not let you pinpoint the location of an affected mind if you don't have line of sight to the subject.
