	You and anyone else you desire inside the area of effect are protected from any undesired teleportation. Any teleportation spell, power, or effect that targets any affected creature automatically fails. When \emph{spacetime anchor} stops a psionic power, you may attempt a psionic contest against that power's manifester. If you win, \emph{spacetime anchor} deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per level of the stopped power to that manifester.

	Each additional creature protected by \emph{spacetime anchor} increases the maintenance cost by 1 power point per round.

	This power does not prevent someone from teleporting themselves away.
