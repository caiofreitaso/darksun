	You change your skin to create a chitinous exoskeleton. However, because the skin is heavily damaged in the process, this is generally a last resort effort. The process causes great discomfort. Your outer layer of skin turns to very hard chitin. You can still be recognized from the front, but your features are contorted and twisted.

	Any clothing or armor must be removed before the power is used: clothing is torn and ruined, while armor causes the power to fail. Once changed you gain +11 natural armor and a $-4$ penalty on your Dexterity score.

	Once the maintenance ends, the exoskeleton painfully breaks away over 5 rounds, taking most of the skin with it. You emerge bloodied, with hit points equal to your level, or 1 hp if your current hit points are less or equal than your level.
