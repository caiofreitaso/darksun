{
	\emph{Project force} allows you to focus a psychokinetic ``punch'' against a target up to 180 meters away.

	If used offensively, this punch causes 1d6 points of damage plus your Constitution modifier. A successful Reflex save reduces the damage by half.

	This rather unsubtle blow can also be used to trigger traps, throw levers, open doors (if they aren't locked or latched), break windows, and the like.

	\textit{Augment:} For every 5 power points you spend, the damage increases by 1d6 (maximum 3d6).
