{
	You initiate a series of random, short-range teleportations that make you very hard to hit in combat. You gain 50\% miss chance purely because of your random teleportations, and the \feat{Blind-Fight} feat doesn't help opponents, since you are constantly changing location and not merely invisible.

	Any individually targeted spell has a 50\% chance to fail against you while you're blinking. Your own spells and psionic powers have 20\% chance to activate just as you blink, causing you to lose briefly line of effect.
