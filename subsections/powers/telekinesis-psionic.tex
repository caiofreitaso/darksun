	\emph{Telekinesis} is the ability to move objects through space without touching them.  All telekinetic efforts tend to be physically taxing, because they involve real work. Moving small, light objects is relatively easy. As the objects become more massive, the task becomes significantly more difficult.

	You can move an object up to 18 meters per round. You can use the object as a weapon. In this case, you attack using your base attack bonus and your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, with a penalty equaling \onethird the object's weight.

	\textit{Augment:} For every additional power point you spend, you increase the weight limit as shown in the table.
