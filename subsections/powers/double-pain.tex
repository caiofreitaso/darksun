{
	By touching another creature, you greatly lower that character's pain threshold. For one minute, the target receives extra nonlethal damage equal to the damage dealt by any attack. This effectively doubles all damage dealt to that creature, although only half of it is lethal.

	The nonlethal damage received by the creature wears out after one minute after the duration expires.
