	\emph{Psionic blast} is a wave of brain force that jolts the target's mind like shocking news.

	As a telepathic attack, \emph{psionic blast} has the following characteristics:
	\begin{itemize*}
		\item Will saving throw DC equal to 10 + \textit{manifester level}. Only psionic creatures can resist attempts of partial \psionic{contact}.
		\item You can attack the same target twice with a single manifestation. This requires two different power checks and two different saving throws (if applicable).
	\end{itemize*}

	\textbf{Contact:} If the target's mind has already been \emph{contacted}, they must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 80\% of their current hit points as nonlethal damage. This damage wears off after one hour.
	
	\textbf{Range:} You can increase the range of this power, but the farther the target is from you, the more difficult it is to use this power.

	\Table{}{CC}{
	  \tableheader Range
	& \tableheader Power Check DC Modifier \\
	18 meters & +0 \\
	36 meters & +2 \\
	60 meters & +5 \\
	}

	\textit{Augment:} For every 2 additional power points you spend, you increase the DC by 1. You can only spend a maximum of 8 additional power points this way.
