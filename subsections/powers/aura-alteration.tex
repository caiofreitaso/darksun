    You can use this power in one of two ways: to disguise the subject's alignment and level, or to remove a compulsion or charm effect from the subject.

    \textit{Disguise:} If you use this power to disguise the subject's alignment and level, the power has a maintenance cost per hour. You can change the subject's alignment by only one step. You can adjust the subject's apparent level up or down by a number equal to one-half your own level (rounded down) or less.

    \textit{Remove Compulsion:} If you use this power to attempt to cleanse the subject's aura of a baleful or controlling effect, the power is instantaneous and the power check DC increases by the level of the effect (minimum +1). This power can remove the compulsion of a curse, a \spell{geas/quest} effect, or a psionic power. When \emph{aura alteration} is manifested for this purpose, the subject gains another saving throw to remove the compulsion afflicting it against the original save DC, but with a +2 bonus.
