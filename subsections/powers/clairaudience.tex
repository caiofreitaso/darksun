	You can hear a distant location almost as if you were there. You don’t need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known---a place familiar to you or an obvious one, such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees. Once you have selected the locale, the focus of your clairvoyant sense doesn’t move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying powers, this power does not allow psionically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it.

	The farther the ``listening spot'' is from you, the more difficult it is to use this power. This power does not work across planes.
