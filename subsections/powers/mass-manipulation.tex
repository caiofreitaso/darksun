	% \textbf{Critical Success:}
	% The weight can be changed from 10\% to 400\% the object's normal value\\

	You can change the way gravity affects an item. Its weight can be changed from 50\% to 200\% its normal value. Weapons made heavier or lighter suffer $-2$ penalty on attack and damage rolls. Lighter objects can thrown twice as far---their range increment is doubled. Armors change their armor penalty accordingly, e.g., a 50\% lighter armor imposes a penalty half the normal value, while a 200\% heavier armor imposes a penalty twice the normal value.

	You can affect a more massive object, but the weight of the object also increases the Difficulty Class of the power check:
