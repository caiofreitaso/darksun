	With this power, you can alter your own dimensions so that you have height and width, but no depth. You become a two-dimensional image that has no thickness; your third dimension is transferred to another plane and remains there as long as you maintain this power. The advantage of this lies in the fact that you simply do not exist if seen from the side. You can fit through the thinnest cracks by edging sideways, as long as there is vertical clearance for you.

	You gain 50\% miss chance due to your new condition. While you are two-dimensional, all damage against you is doubled.
