	The \emph{psionic disintegrate} power reduces an object or creature to microscopic pieces and scatters them. Anything is vulnerable unless it is protected by \spell{lesser globe of invulnerability}, \spell{globe of invulnerability}, or by an \psionic{inertial barrier}.

	When used against an object, you can disintegrate no more than 0.25 m$^3$ of material with one use of this power. Thus, the power disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted.

	A creature that fails a Fortitude save takes 5d12 points of damage. If this damage reduces the object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.

	\emph{Augment:} For every additional power point you spend, the damage increases by 1d12 points.
