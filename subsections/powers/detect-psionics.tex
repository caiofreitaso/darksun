	You can detect psionic activity anywhere within range. Any expenditure of power points constitutes psionic activity, even if it only to maintain a power.

	During each round, you may attempt a power check. The amount of information you gather each round depends on the number of successes:

	\textit{1st success:} You detect if there is any psionic activity besides your own.

	\textit{2nd success:} You know where the sources of psionic activity are (direction and distance).

	\textit{3rd success:} You know how many power points are being spent by each source.
