	When you manifest \emph{reddopsi}, powers targeted against you rebound to affect the original manifester. This effect reverses powers that have only you as a target (except \psionic{dispel psionics} and similar powers or effects). Powers that affect an area and those that produce effects can't be reversed. \emph{Reddopsi} also can't reverse any power with a range of touch.

	Should you rebound a power back against a manifester who also is protected by \emph{reddopsi}, the power rebounds once more upon you.
