	You can improve all targets' initiative count for the next round and all subsequent rounds you maintain this power. When you manifest this power, their initiative count improves by 1, and their place in the initiative order changes accordingly. This modifier applies at the end of the round. Their place in the initiative order changes to reflect \emph{combat mind}'s effect starting with the next round.

	\textit{Augment:} You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.
	\begin{enumerate*}
		\item For every 10 additional power points you spend, this power can affect an additional target. Any additional target cannot be more than 6 meters from another target of the power.
		\item For every 3 additional power points you spend, the initiative count improvement increases by 1.
	\end{enumerate*}
