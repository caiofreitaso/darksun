	You can dig into a target's subconscious deeper than the \psionic{read thoughts} power can. All memories and knowledge are accessible to you: from memories deep below the surface to those still fresh in the subject's mind. Information you gain is not necessarily true, but it is true as far as the subject knows.

	You can learn the answer to one question per round. Yes or no questions are answered as a standard action, while complex questions may take multiple rounds to be answered.

	If a \emph{probed} subject is a spellcaster, you know both that a spell is being cast and what the general effects of that spell are.
