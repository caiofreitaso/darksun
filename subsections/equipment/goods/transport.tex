\subsection{Transport}
Sometimes it is too hard or too dangerous to ride a kank---you'll need some other form of transportation. Some vehicles, such as the chariot and howdah, are moved by muscle power. The \skill{Handle Animal} skill is used only if that power comes from a team of draft animals. When the team consists of creatures with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher, the operative skill is \skill{Diplomacy}. When they are slaves or forced labor, the operative skill is \skill{Intimidate}.

\textbf{Chariot}: A chariot is a two-wheeled vehicle used for transportation, racing, war and processions. Transport chariots are very small and simple, requiring only a single animal to draw it. A war chariot built for two riders is slightly larger, but significantly better constructed. Generally one person will drive the chariot while the other uses a bow or other ranged weapon. A war chariot built for four is much larger than the other two kinds of chariots and requires at least two mounts to drive it. A war chariot offers cover to its occupants.

\textbf{Howdah}: A howdah is an enclosure mounted on a riding animal containing space for one or more persons. Howdahs can be fitted on inix or mekillots, and provide shade and cover from the elements. An inix howdah usually has room for only one person, though the war howdah, built much stronger, can hold four. A mekillot howdah can hold one or two persons, but a war howdah is much bigger, consisting of two levels and holding up to sixteen warriors.

\textbf{Wagon}: Wagons are an essential part of Athasian economy, as they facilitate the caravans that make life in the wastes possible. Open wagons are basic, open-topped wagons that can carry a certain amount of cargo. As Athasian wagons are built using little or no metal, there's a limit to how much cargo they can carry. Open wagons generally require two beasts to draw them, but sometimes a single erdland will work.

\textit{Enclosed wagons}: They are more commonly used to transport people or fragile cargo that would otherwise be damaged by exposure to the elements.

\textit{Armored wagons}: They are primarily used by caravans traveling through areas plagued by dangerous monsters or raiders. It is an enclosed wagon with agafari wood used to strengthen the wagon throughout. There are also mount points for fixed crossbows on each side of that wagon that can swivel 180 degrees. Anyone using the crossbows or firing out of the rear of the wagon (when it is open) receives cover. Armored wagons require at least four smaller mounts to draw it, two inixes or one mekillot.
