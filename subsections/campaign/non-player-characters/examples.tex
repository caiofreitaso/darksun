\MonsterStatsDescription{
    Caravan sergeants serve as leaders for squads of footmen or cavalry. The statistics block is for a human 1st-level bard/5th-level fighter with the military officer archetype.

    Caravan sergeants speak Common and their merchant house's language.
}

Caravan sergeants use their \emph{inspire courage} at their first round, to improve their squad's combat abilities, and keep using coordinate allies in the following rounds improving attack rolls or AC as needed.

They only go to the front line if there is no other option, as their job is to command their squad, not to be a dashing fighter. However, when they do fight, they will use the \feat{Combat Expertise} feat to improve their AC if they can hit easily.

\textbf{Bardic Knowledge:} A caravan sergeant has +2 on bardic knowledge checks.

\textbf{Bardic Music (Su):} A caravan sergeant has the bardic music ability 5/day as a 1st-level bard: \emph{countersong}, \emph{fascinate} 1 creature, and \emph{inspire courage} +1.

\textbf{Coordinate Allies (Ex):} As a full-round action, the caravan sergeant can make a Knowledge (warcraft) check with a DC equal to 15 + the number of allies affected. If the check succeeds, all affected allies gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls or a +1 dodge bonus to AC. They choose which of the two benefits to impart and must impart the same benefit to all affected allies. The benefits last for 1 round. The caravan sergeant cannot use this ability on themselves.

\textbf{Military Training:} A caravan sergeant gain +1 permanent bonus on Constitution.

    Agents speak Common and their merchant house's language.
}

Unless they have no other option, agents will try to persuade their opponents to avoid any combat. If combat is inevitable, they will use 

\textbf{Agent (Ex):} An agent of a merchant house gains a circumstance bonus on a related skill:

\textit{House Inika:} +2 circumstance bonus on \skill{Gather Information} checks.

\textit{House M'ke:} +2 circumstance bonus on \skill{Sense Motive} checks.

\textit{House Shom:} +2 circumstance bonus on \skill{Bluff} checks.

\textit{House Stel:} +2 circumstance bonus on \skill{Knowledge} (warcraft) checks.

\textit{House Tsalaxa:} +2 circumstance bonus on \skill{Intimidate} checks.

\textit{House Vordon:} +2 circumstance bonus on \skill{Appraise} checks.

\textit{House Wavir:} +2 circumstance bonus on \skill{Diplomacy} checks.

\textit{Other Houses:} +1 circumstance bonus on checks of a skill of choice.

\textbf{Bardic Knowledge:} An agent has +5 on bardic knowledge checks.

\textbf{Bardic Music (Su):} An agent has the bardic music ability 4/day as a 4th-level bard: \emph{countersong}, \emph{fascinate} 2 creatures, and \emph{inspire courage} +1.

\textbf{Bargainer:} Whenever an agent bargains, the result of this \skill{Diplomacy} opposed check is always one step better for him. In addition, agents can use caravans of smaller houses to move around the Tablelands.

\textbf{Contact:} An agent has one contact who he can ask for a favor once per week. Contacts come in three varieties, one of which he must choose: influence contacts, skill contacts, and trade contacts (see \hyperref[sec:contacts]{Contacts}).

\textbf{Master Linguist (Ex):} Whenever an agent encounters a new language, either spoken or written, that he does not know, he can make an Intelligence check (for a spoken language) or a \skill{Decipher Script} check (for a written language) to determine if he can understand it.

The DC for the check is DC 15 if the language is commonly spoken, or DC 25 if the language is ancient or unique. Success means he can glean enough meaning from a conversation or document to ascertain the basic message, but this ability in no way simulates actually being able to converse or fluently read and write in a given language. A single check covers roughly one minute of a spoken language or one page of a written language.

\textbf{Poison Use:} An agent is trained in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning himself when applying poison to a blade.

\textbf{Smooth Talk (Ex):} An agent can retry \skill{Bluff} and \skill{Diplomacy} checks at a $-5$ penalty, but only once per check.

* An agent has +2 insight bonus to \skill{Bluff} and \skill{Sleight of Hand} checks, +2 competence bonus to \skill{Gather Information} and \skill{Intimidate} checks, +1 competence bonus on \skill{Diplomacy} checks.

\subsubsection{Senior Agent}
\MonsterStatsDescription{
    Merchant house senior agents are representatives of their merchant houses. The statistics block is for a human 4th-level bard/7rd-level dune trader with the merchant archetype.

\textit{House Wavir:} +3 circumstance bonus on \skill{Diplomacy} checks.

\textit{Other Houses:} +2 circumstance bonus on checks of a skill of choice.

\textbf{Bardic Knowledge:} A senior agent has +6 on bardic knowledge checks.

\textbf{Bardic Music (Su):} A senior agent has the bardic music ability 4/day as a 4th-level bard: \emph{countersong}, \emph{fascinate} 2 creatures, and \emph{inspire courage} +1.

\textbf{Bargainer:} Whenever an agent bargains, the result of this \skill{Diplomacy} opposed check is always one step better for him. In addition, agents can use caravans of smaller houses to move around the Tablelands.

\textbf{Contact:} A senior agent has three contacts who he can ask for a favor once per week, per contact. Contacts come in three varieties, one of which he must choose: influence contacts, skill contacts, and trade contacts (see \hyperref[sec:contacts]{Contacts}).

\textbf{Dazzle (Ex):} A senior agent can dazzle two creatures through sheer force of personality, a winning smile, and fast-talking. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 27 meters, able to see, hear and understand the senior agent, and able to pay attention to him. The senior agent must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working.

As a move action, the senior agent makes an opposed \skill{Bluff} check against each. If he succeeds on the check, the creature receives a $-1$ penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for seven rounds.

This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.

\textbf{Fast Talk (Ex):} A senior agent may make a rushed \skill{Diplomacy} check as a full-round action with a $-5$ penalty instead of the normal $-10$ penalty.

\textbf{Master Linguist (Ex):} Whenever an agent encounters a new language, either spoken or written, that he does not know, he can make an Intelligence check (for a spoken language) or a \skill{Decipher Script} check (for a written language) to determine if he can understand it.

The DC for the check is DC 15 if the language is commonly spoken, or DC 25 if the language is ancient or unique. Success means he can glean enough meaning from a conversation or document to ascertain the basic message, but this ability in no way simulates actually being able to converse or fluently read and write in a given language. A single check covers roughly one minute of a spoken language or one page of a written language.

\textbf{Poison Use:} A senior agent is trained in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning himself when applying poison to a blade.

\textbf{Smooth Talk (Ex):} A senior agent can retry \skill{Bluff} and \skill{Diplomacy} checks at a $-5$ penalty, but only once per check.

\textbf{Slippery Mind (Ex):} If a senior agent is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails his saving throw, he can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. He gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.

* An agent has +2 insight bonus to \skill{Bluff} and \skill{Sleight of Hand} checks, +2 competence bonus to \skill{Gather Information} and \skill{Intimidate} checks, +3 competence bonus on \skill{Diplomacy} checks. An agent may take 10 on \skill{Bluff}, \skill{Diplomacy}, \skill{Gather Information}, \skill{Sense Motive}, and \skill{Sleight of Hand} checks even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him from doing so.

\subsubsection{Raider}
\MonsterStatsDescription{
	Raiders exist to prey on the weak, taking whatever they can from their victims. They attack caravans and pillage what they can. The statistics block is for a human 3rd-level barbarian with the raider archetype.

	Raiders speak only Common.
}

Raiders rely on being stronger and in larger numbers than their prey and don't waste time by thinking too much about their tactics.

A raider normally attacks using his \feat{Power Attack} feat, taking $-2$ penalty on his attack rolls, and gaining a +4 bonus on damage rolls.

\textbf{Bad Reputation:} Raiders are easily recognizable wherever they go, be it for their posture, their facial tattoos, or their behavior. When a raider is in a settlement, they can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report their activity to the authorities.

\textbf{Rage (Ex):} Once per day, a raider can enter a state of fierce rage that last for 7 rounds. At the end of his rage, the raider is fatigued for the duration of the encounter.

\textbf{Uncanny Dodge (Ex):} A raider retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

\textbf{Wasteland Sense (Ex):} A raider can add his Constitution bonus (if any) as natural armor bonus on his Armor Class, and on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and natural hazards. He loses this bonus when he is wearing heavy armor or tower shields, when immobilized or helpless, or when carrying a medium or heavy load.


\subsubsection{Raider Captain}
\MonsterStatsDescription{
	The information on the statistics block is for a human 6th-level barbarian with the raider archetype.
}

Captains usually lead a raiding squad into the wastelands, looking for new victims.

A raider captain normally attacks using his \feat{Power Attack} feat, taking $-2$ penalty on his attack rolls, and gaining a +4 bonus on damage rolls.

\textbf{Bad Reputation:} Raiders are easily recognizable wherever they go, be it for their posture, their facial tattoos, or their behavior. When a raider is in a settlement, they can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report their activity to the authorities.

\textbf{Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):} A raider captain cannot be flanked; he retains his Dexterity bonus to AC regardless of being caught flat-footed or attacked by an invisible opponent. This defense is denied to the creature if it is attacked by a thief of 10th level or higher.

\textbf{Pouncing Rage (Ex):} While in rage, a raider captain gains the pounce ability, allowing him to make a full attack at the end of a charge.

\textbf{Rage (Ex):} Twice per day, a raider captain can enter a state of fierce rage that last for 7 rounds. At the end of his rage, the raider captain is fatigued for the duration of the encounter.

\textbf{Uncanny Dodge (Ex):} A raider captain retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

\textbf{Wasteland Sense (Ex):} A raider captain can add his Constitution bonus (if any) as natural armor bonus on his Armor Class, and on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and natural hazards. He loses this bonus when he is wearing heavy armor or tower shields, when immobilized or helpless, or when carrying a medium or heavy load.
