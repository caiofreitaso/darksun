Caravan sergeants speak Common and their merchant house's language.

\textbf{Combat:} Caravan sergeants use their \emph{inspire courage} at their first round, to improve their squad's combat abilities, and keep using coordinate allies in the following rounds improving attack rolls or AC as needed.

They only go to the front line if there is no other option, as their job is to command their squad, not to be a dashing fighter. However, when they do fight, they will use the \feat{Combat Expertise} feat to improve their AC if they can hit easily.

\textit{Bardic Knowledge:} A caravan sergeant +2 on bardic knowledge checks.

\textit{Bardic Music (Su):} A caravan sergeant has the bardic music ability 5/day as a 1st-level bard: \emph{countersong}, \emph{fascinate} 1 creature, and \emph{inspire courage} +1.

\textit{Coordinate Allies (Ex):} As a full-round action, the caravan sergeant can make a Knowledge (warcraft) check with a DC equal to 15 + the number of allies affected. If the check succeeds, all affected allies gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls or a +1 dodge bonus to AC.
