\subsection{Maximum Hit Dice}
% Some spells stop working, hit points and damage become too great at high levels. This variant imposes a maximum number of hit dice any character can have, and beyond that characters only gain additional hit points instead.
In this variant, each player character can have up to 10 Hit Dice, gaining bonus hit points by their Constitution modifier as normal. Beyond the 10th HD, characters gain only a fixed amount of hit points determined by the Hit Die from their class, without any bonus hit points from their Constitution modifier.

\Table{}{CC}{
  \tableheader Hit Die
& \tableheader Bonus Hit Points \\
d4  & 1 \\
d6  & 2 \\
d8  & 3 \\
d10 & 4 \\
d12 & 5 \\
}

\subsubsection{Power Attack}
Since characters have fewer hit points than normal, the \feat{Power Attack} feat become increasingly more efficient over the levels. Because of this, the \feat{Power Attack} feat has a maximum penalty of $-10$ in this variant.

\subsubsection{Monster Races}
Having a maximum number of Hit Dice gives a hard stop on the number of playable monster races. In this variant, monsters with 10 or more Hit Dice are not playable, even if they have Level Adjustment.
