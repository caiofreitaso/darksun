\subsection{No Shapechanging}
This variant removes all shapechanging abilities from any class. Since their effects impact both the time of a session and the power level of the adventure, removing shapechanging is a way to improve the play experience in some groups.

\subsubsection{Wild Shape}
Classes grant animal companion (as a ranger), instead of wild shape. Any further improvement on wild shape is lost.

With this change, the \feat{Druidic Hunter} and \feat{Natural Spell} feats are also removed.

\subsubsection{Prestige Classes}
The following prestige classes cease to function in this environment: master of many forms\textsuperscript{CAd}, master transmogrifist\textsuperscript{CAr}.

\textbf{Grove Master:} Grove master levels stack with druid or ranger levels for animal companion purposes.

\subsubsection{Spells}
The following spells are removed:
\spell{alter self},
\spell{animal shapes},
\spell{polymorph},
\spell{polymorph any object},
\spell{shapechange}.

With the removal of these spells, the Animal domain has the following replacements:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item[7.] \spellList{Summon Nature's Ally VII}: Calls creature to fight.
	\item[9.] \spellList{Wild Lands}: Attract wild creatures to an area.
\end{itemize*}


\subsubsection{Powers}
The following psionic powers are removed:
\psionic{animal affinity},
\psionic{metamorphosis}.

With the removal of these powers, the \feat{Metamorphic Transfer} feat is also removed.
