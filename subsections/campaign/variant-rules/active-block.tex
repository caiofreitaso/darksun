\subsection{Active Block}
Whenever you would be hit by an attack, you can attempt an active block to prevent the hit. Blocking uses an attack of opportunity to deflect incoming attack with a shield or buckler. You can't block without a shield or buckler.

The active block maneuver is available only when fighting defensively, using the \feat{Combat Expertise} feat, or using total defense (this is a special case for attacks of opportunities).

New feats are also needed for this new maneuver.

\subsubsection{Block Checks}
An active block replaces your AC with the result of a special attack roll:

\begin{Formula*}{1d20 + \textit{attack bonus} + \textit{defense bonus}}
  \item \textit{Attack bonus} = base attack bonus + Str. modifier + size modifier.
  \item \textit{Defense bonus} = shield bonus + dodge bonus.
\end{Formula*}

Any penalties on attack rolls apply to this special attack roll.

\textbf{Automatic Hits:} A natural 20 is always a successful block.

\textbf{Weapon Finesse:} You may use your Dexterity modifier on block rolls, if you carry a buckler.

\GFeat[Fighter]{Intensify Blocking}
