\subsection{Improved Saving Throws}
This variant improves the progression of saving throws, and it is best used when magic items are hard to find. This variant also seeks to alleviate the problem that arises with multiclass characters with high base saving throws.

In this variant, good saving throws use \threequarters the level (as the cleric's BAB) and bad saving throws use \onehalf the level (as the wizard's BAB).

\subsubsection{1st-level Saving Throws}
At 1st level, characters need every 5\% chance they can get to survive. In order to make characters more viable, each character should gain a bonus feat to boost their saving throws. This bonus feat only applies to a character's 1st-level class. Multiclass characters do not gain multiple bonus feats.
