\subsection{Improved Saving Throws}
This variant improves the progression of saving throws, and it is best used when magic items are hard to find. This variant also seeks to alleviate the problem that arises with multiclass characters with extreme base saving throws. With this variant, it is recommended to not use \emph{mantle of resistance} or any item that improves saving throws even more.

In this variant, good saving throws use the level (as the fighter's BAB) and bad saving throws use \onehalf the level (as the wizard's BAB).
