	You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is 3 meters deep plus an additional 1.5 meter deep per three caster levels above 9th (4.5 meters at 12th, 6 meters at 15th, and a maximum of 7.5 meters deep at 18th level). If the wall's thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single \emph{passwall} simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several \emph{passwall} spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When \emph{passwall} ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the \emph{passwall} or you dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there is one, or out the sole exit if there is only one.

	\textit{Material Component:}
	A pinch of sesame seeds.
