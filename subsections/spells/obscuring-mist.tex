{
	A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 1.5 meter. A creature 1.5 meter away has concealment (attacks have a 20\% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50\% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

	A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

	This spell does not function underwater.
