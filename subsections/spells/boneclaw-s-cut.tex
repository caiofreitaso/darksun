	The victim of the \emph{boneclaw's cut} suffers wounds as if from a boneclaw's talons. The victim receives one cut per four caster levels (to a maximum of five cuts at 20th level). Each cut inflicts 2 point of damage and continues to bleed, dealing an additional 2 points of damage per round for 10 rounds (for a total of 20 points of damage per cut). A successful \skill{Heal} check (DC 15) or use of a \spellref{cure light wounds}{cure} spell prevents the wounds from bleeding further.

	\textit{Focus:} A knife made from a boneclaw's talon.
