	This spell functions like \spell{silent image}, except that the figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components, and the figment follows a script determined by you. The figment follows that script without your having to concentrate on it. The illusion can include intelligible speech if you wish.

	\textit{Material Component}:
	A bit of fleece and several grains of sand.
