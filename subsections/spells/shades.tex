{Illusion (Shadow)}
{
	\textbf{Level:}
	Wiz 9\\
}
{
	This spell functions like shadow conjuration, except that it mimics sorcerer and wizard conjuration spells of 8th level or lower. The illusory conjurations created deal four-fifths (80\%) damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 80\% likely to work against nonbelievers.
