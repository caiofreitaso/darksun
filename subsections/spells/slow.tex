{
	An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. A slowed creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 1.5-meter increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.

	Multiple slow effects don't stack. Slow counters and dispels haste.

	\textit{Material Component}:
	A drop of molasses.
