	The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. (This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.)

	A winged creature who is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown.
