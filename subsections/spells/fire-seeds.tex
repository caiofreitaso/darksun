{
	Depending on the version of fire seeds you choose, you turn acorns into splash weapons that you or another character can throw, or you turn holly berries into bombs that you can detonate on command.

	\textit{Acorn Grenades}:
	As many as four acorns turn into special splash weapons that can be hurled as far as 30 meters. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target. Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), divided up among the acorns as you wish.

	Each acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface. In addition to its regular fire damage, it deals 1 point of splash damage per die, and it ignites any combustible materials within 3 meters. A creature within this area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage; a creature struck directly is not allowed a saving throw.

	\textit{Holly Berry Bombs}:
	You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 1.5 meter). If you are within 60 meters and speak a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level to every creature in a 1.5-meter radius burst and igniting any combustible materials within 1.5 meter. A creature in the area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage.

	\textit{Material Component}:
	The acorns or holly berries.
