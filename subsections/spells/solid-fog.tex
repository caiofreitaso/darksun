	This spell functions like \spell{fog cloud}, but in addition to obscuring sight, the \emph{solid fog} is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 1.5 meter, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes a $-2$ penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into \emph{solid fog} is slowed, so that each 3 meters of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A creature can't take a 1.5-meter step while in \emph{solid fog}.

	However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.

	\emph{Solid fog} can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} spell. A permanent \emph{solid fog} dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

	\textit{Material Component:}
	A pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with powdered animal hoof.
