	This spell functions like \spell{symbol of death}, except that all creatures within the radius of a symbol of persuasion instead become charmed by the caster (as the charm monster spell) for 1 hour per caster level.

	Unlike symbol of death, symbol of persuasion has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of persuasion simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

	\textit{Note:} Magic traps such as symbol of persuasion are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of persuasion and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for symbol of persuasion.

	\textit{Material Component}:
	Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 cp.
