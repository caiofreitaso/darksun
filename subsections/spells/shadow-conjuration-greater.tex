{
	This spell functions like \spell{shadow conjuration}, except that it can duplicate any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 6th level or lower. The illusory conjurations created deal three-fifths (60\%) damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 60\% likely to work against nonbelievers.
