	\textbf{Level:}
	Clr 1\\
}
{
	This spell functions like \spell{detect evil}, except that it detects the auras of good creatures, good clerics, good spells, and good magic items, and you are vulnerable to an overwhelming good aura if you are evil. Healing potions, antidotes, and similar beneficial items are not good.
