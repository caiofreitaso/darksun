{
	When cast, this spell not only prevents divination spells from working to detect or locate the creature or object affected by \emph{sequester}, it also renders the affected creature or object invisible to any form of sight or seeing (as the \spell{invisibility} spell). The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by \emph{sequester} become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell wears off or is dispelled.

	\textit{Note:} The Will save prevents an attended or magical object from being sequestered. There is no save to see the sequestered creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.

	\textit{Material Component:}
	A basilisk eyelash, gum arabic, and a dram of whitewash.
