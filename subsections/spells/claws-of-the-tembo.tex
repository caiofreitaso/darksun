{
	You grow vicious claws similar to those of a tembo. You may make two claw attacks per round, each dealing 1d6 (1d8 if you are Large, or 1d4 if you are Small) points of damage plus your Strength modifier.

	Like the dreaded tembo, your claws can drain a victim's life force and transfer it to you. Every time you hit with a claw, the creature struck must make a Fortitude save. If it fails, it takes an additional 1d4 points of damage, and you heal that many hit points. If the transferred hit points bring your total above your normal maximum, the additional hit points are temporary hit points.

	You are unable to cast spells with somatic components while this spell is in effect.

	\textit{Material Component:} A scale from a tembo.
