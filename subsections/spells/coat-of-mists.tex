{
	You gather a magical mist around a creature. The mist absorbs the first 5 points of damage from any fire-based effects each round. It also provides the same protection against hot weather as the \spell{endure elements} spell, and grants the creature concealment (20\% miss chance) as the \spell{blur} spell.

	Further castings of \emph{coat of mists} do not have any effect, and \emph{coat of mists}' damage absorption does not stack with any other kind of energy resistance.

	\textit{Material Component:} 4 liters of water.
