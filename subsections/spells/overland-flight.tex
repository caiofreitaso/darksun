	This spell functions like a \spell{fly} spell, except you can fly at a speed of 12 meters (9 meters if wearing medium or heavy armor, or if carrying a medium or heavy load) with average maneuverability. When using this spell for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution checks). This means you can cover 96 kilometers in an eight-hour period of flight (or 72 kilometers at a speed of 9 meters).
