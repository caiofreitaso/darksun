	Creatures caught in the blast suffer 10d6 points of fire damage (no save) and automatically catch on fire. Creatures on fire suffer 2d6 points of fire damage for each round. Unlike mundane fire, this fire cannot be put out by normal means.

	Spraying a creature caught on fire by this spell with water or sand only creates a billowing cloud of steam or hot dust out to 6 meters from the target; instead of the normal damage, creatures within the cloud suffer 5d6 points of fire damage and are sickened for one round. Complete immersion in a large amount of water, or burial beneath the sand, reduces damage to 1d6 point per round for both the creature on fire and those within 6 meters. A successful \spell{dispel magic} or \spell{quench} spell puts out the fire.
