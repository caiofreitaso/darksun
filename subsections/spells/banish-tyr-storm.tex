{
	This spell repels Tyr-storms from a particular area. You are able to force the storm to leave its normal path and head off in a direction of your choice. The storm continues to rage and causes normal damage wherever it goes, but the spell allows you keep it out of an area you want to protect.

	\textit{Focus:} A blue lens worth 100 cp.
