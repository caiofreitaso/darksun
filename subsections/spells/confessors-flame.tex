	This spell allows you to demand questions of any creature within range. If the creature does not reply with what you consider to be the correct answer to the question, within one round, part of the creature's body bursts into flame. While some claim that this spell detects falsehoods, in fact the answer is pre-determined by the caster.

	Subjects can avoid damage by telling you exactly what you want to hear. Ignorance or silence is no defense. Targets can escape by leaving the spell's range or by silencing or killing you, preventing you from asking more questions.

	The spell is limited to 10 questions---one per round. You can pose all the questions to one creature, or shift your questioning to another creature within range, as suits your whim. The first time that a question is answered ``incorrectly'' (or not answered) a target takes 1d12 fire damage, the second time, 2d12 damage, the third time, 3d12 damage, and so on. A target must answer your question (correctly) within one round or take damage.

	\textit{Focus:} An open flame.
