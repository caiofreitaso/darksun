{
	This spell functions like gust of wind; except that the effect is force-based and that the creature sizes affected by the spell are increased by one size category (i.e. Large creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the blast).

	The roaring blast is sufficient to tear objects from unsuspecting hands within the area of effect. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Arrows, bolts, and spears are deflected away and miss. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Incorporeal creatures, gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form are shunted away from the area of the blast.
