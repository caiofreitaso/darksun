	This spell functions like \spell{interposing hand}, except the hand can also grapple one opponent that you select. The grasping hand gets one grapple attack per round.

	Its attack bonus to make contact equals your caster level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for wizards and templars, respectively), +10 for the hand's Strength score (31), $-1$ for being Large. Its grapple bonus is this same figure, except with a +4 modifier for being Large instead of $-1$. The hand holds but does not harm creatures it grapples.

	Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

	The grasping hand can also bull rush an opponent as forceful hand does, but at a +16 bonus on the Strength check (+10 for Strength 31, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets), or interpose itself as interposing hand does.

	Templars who cast this spell name it for their sorcerer-kings.
	% Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities.

	\textit{Arcane Focus}:
	A leather glove.
