{
	This spell restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to survive the process. Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored.

	The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available. (For example, this spell would turn a stone golem into a flesh golem, but an ordinary statue would become a corpse.) You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 30 centimeters to 1 meter in diameter and up to 3 meters long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.

	\textit{Material Component:}
	A pinch of earth and a drop of blood.
