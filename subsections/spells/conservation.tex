	If a defiler tries to use land that is under a \emph{conservation} spell to power his spells, he must make a Will save or be unable to use the land at all. Even if he succeeds, the land is considered as barren terrain for the purposes of determining the spell's DC and level check modifier.

	The area of ash the defiler actually creates when tapping land under a \emph{conservation} spell is half that of normal. A second attempt to pull power from the same area for the duration of the spell fails completely, regardless of any success achieved the first time.

	\textit{Material Component:} A drop of water, a drop of blood, and a sifting of ash.
