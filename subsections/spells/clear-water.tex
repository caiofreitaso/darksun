	You make water twice as effective at quenching thirst and nourishing plant life. A creature only needs to drink half as much \emph{clear water} as it would need to drink normal water. For example, an active human needs only 2 liters of \emph{clear water} each day to avoid dehydration, instead of the normal 4 liters. When used to grow plants, \emph{clear water} can double the yield of fruit or grain-bearing plants, but this benefit only comes if \emph{clear water} is used to irrigate the crop every day.
