{
	You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits your purpose. While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with \emph{stone shape}, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30\% chance that any shape including moving parts simply doesn't work.

	\textit{Arcane Material Component:}
	Soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object and then touched to the stone while the verbal component is uttered.
