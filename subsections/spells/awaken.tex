{
	You awaken a tree or animal to humanlike sentience. To succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + the animal's current HD, or the HD the tree will have once \emph{awakened}).

	The \emph{awakened} animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.

	An \emph{awakened} tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. An \emph{awakened} plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human's.

	An \emph{awakened} animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An \emph{awakened} animal can't serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.

	An \emph{awakened} tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any).

	\textit{XP Cost}:
	250 XP.
