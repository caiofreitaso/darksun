{
	A twisting pattern of discordant, coruscating colors weaves through the air, affecting creatures within it. The spell affects a total number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. The spell affects each subject according to its Hit Dice.

	\textit{6 or less:}
Unconscious for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then confused for 1d4 rounds. (Treat an unconscious result as stunned for nonliving creatures.)

	\textit{7 to 12:}
	Stunned for 1d4 rounds, then confused for 1d4 rounds.

	\textit{13 or more:}
	Confused for 1d4 rounds.

	Sightless creatures are not affected by scintillating pattern.

	A small crystal prism.
