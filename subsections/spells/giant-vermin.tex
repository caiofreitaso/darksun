	You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a single normal-sized scorpion into larger forms. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider), and all must be grown to the same size. The size to which the vermin can be grown depends on your level; see the table.

	Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (``Attack,'' ``Defend,'' ``Stop,'' and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whoever or whatever is near them.
