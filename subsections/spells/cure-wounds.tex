{
	When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1 point of damage.

	Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.

	\textit{Heighten Spell:} When you cast it using a spell slot higher, the spell cures an additional 1d8+2 points of damage for each spell slot level above.
