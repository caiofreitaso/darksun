\Spell{Teleport, Greater}{greater teleport}
{Conjuration (Teleportation)}
{
	\textbf{Level:}
	Wiz 7, Travel 7\\
}
{
	This spell functions like \spell{teleport}, except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.
