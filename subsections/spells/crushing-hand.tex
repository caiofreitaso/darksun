	This spell functions like \spell{interposing hand}, except that the hand can interpose itself, push, or crush one opponent that you select.

	The crushing hand can grapple an opponent like grasping hand does. Its grapple bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for a wizard or templar, respectively), +12 for the hand's Strength score (35), +4 for being Large. The hand deals 2d6+12 points of damage (lethal, not nonlethal) on each successful grapple check against an opponent.

	The crushing hand can also interpose itself as interposing hand does, or it can bull rush an opponent as forceful hand does, but at a +18 bonus.

	Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.
