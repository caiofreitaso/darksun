	When this spell is cast, it causes bone to harden and become less brittle. Bones under the affect of this spell are harder to break than normal. If used on an inferior bone weapon, this spell removes the normal penalties to attack rolls. If cast on a creature, the creature's bones harden, causing them to ache and the joints to swell. This gives the creature a $-4$ penalty to Dexterity. Creatures without a skeleton (elementals, oozes, plants and most constructs) are unaffected by this spell.

	\textit{Material Component:} A bit of mortar.
