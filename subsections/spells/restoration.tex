	This spell functions like \spell{lesser restoration}, except that it also dispels negative levels and restores one experience level to a creature who has had a level drained. The drained level is restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than one day per caster level. A character who has a level restored by restoration has exactly the minimum number of experience points necessary to restore him or her to his or her previous level.

	Restoration cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.

	Restoration does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.

	\textit{Material Component}:
	Diamond dust worth 100 gp that is sprinkled over the target.
