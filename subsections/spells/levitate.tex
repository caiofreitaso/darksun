	\emph{Levitate} allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be \emph{levitated}, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 6 meters each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).

	A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a $-1$ penalty on attack rolls, the second $-2$, and so on, to a maximum penalty of $-5$. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at $-1$.

	\textit{Focus:}
	Either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end.
