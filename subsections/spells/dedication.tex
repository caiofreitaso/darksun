	This potent spell provides benefits to a single creature that is engaged in an ongoing activity, which must be named at the time the spell is cast. Any activity that requires focus or exertion can be named, such as digging a large trench, repairing a wall, or reading a lengthy tome.

	While engaged in this activity, the target needs no sleep for the duration of the spell, needs only one-half of the food and water it normally would, and cannot becomes exhausted or fatigued. The target also receives a +1 morale bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks, provided that it relates directly to the aforementioned task. At the end of the spell's duration, the creature must rest for eight hours or become exhausted and suffer 1d4 points of temporary Constitution damage.

	This spell can only be cast on a creature once every 72 hours. If dedication is cast on a creature more than once in a single 72-hour period, it suffers 1d4 points of temporary Constitution damage, and the spell has no other effect.
