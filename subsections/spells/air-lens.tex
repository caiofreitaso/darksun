{
	You shape the air into a magical lens that you can use to direct intensified sunrays. If sunlight becomes unavailable, the spell prematurely ends. You can make ranged touch attacks with the air lens. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing multiple attacks per round). The lens inflicts 2d6 points of fire damage +1 per caster level. Creatures that are especially vulnerable to sunlight (such as some undead) take double damage. You can use an air lens attack to ignite unattended combustible materials such as dry sticks, straw, parchment and cloth.
