\Spell{Symbol of Pain}{symbol of pain}
{Necromancy [Evil]}
{
	\textbf{Level:}
	Clr 5, Wiz 5\\
}
{
	This spell functions like \spell{symbol of death}, except that each creature within the radius of a symbol of pain instead suffers wracking pains that impose a $-4$ penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 18 meters from the symbol.

	Unlike symbol of death, symbol of pain has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of pain simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

	\textit{Note:} Magic traps such as symbol of pain are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of pain and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for symbol of pain.

	\textit{Material Component:}
	Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 cp.
