{
	The unfortunate victim of this curse is unable to drink water for the duration of the spell. When he puts a container to his lips, the water inside turns to sand, usually pouring down the unfortunate victim's throat. If the victim hasn't died from dehydration when the spell ends, he may begin to drink normally. Of course, everything that had turned to sand remains sand. The spell terminates if the cursed person is completely immersed under water, and can also be broken by spells that end other divine curses.
