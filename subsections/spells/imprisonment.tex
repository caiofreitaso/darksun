	When you cast \emph{imprisonment} and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the \spell{temporal stasis} spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The subject remains there unless a freedom spell is cast at the locale where the \emph{imprisonment} took place. Magical search by a crystal ball, a \spell{locate object} spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but \spell{discern location} does. A \spell{wish} or \spell{miracle} spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a $-4$ penalty on its save.
