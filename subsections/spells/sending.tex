{
	You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of twenty-five words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the \emph{sending}, though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence score. Even if the \emph{sending} is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.

	If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5\% chance that the \emph{sending} does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)

	\textit{Arcane Material Component:}
	A short piece of fine copper wire.
