{
	When \emph{cooling canopy} is cast, a 9-m-radius blue cloud gathers in the sky far above the target's head. This cloud blocks the direct rays of the sun and provides shade for anyone within the spell's radius. Those so protected need only one-half their normal water ration (or one-quarter if resting instead of traveling) needed to prevent dehydration. A creature must spend the majority of the 12 hours underneath the \emph{cooling canopy} to decrease their required water intake.

	\textit{Material Component:} A drop of water.

	\textit{Focus:} A filmy bit of material (anything will do) stretched over the top of a stick or twig.
