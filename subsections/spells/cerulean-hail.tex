{
	The hailstones deal 1d6 points of damage per caster level to all creatures and structures in the area of effect (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is cold damage, and the other half is bludgeoning damage. Creatures who make a successful Reflex save reduce the damage by half. The cloud remains for one full round, but the hailstones are instantaneous---they fall only once and evaporate upon impact. All creatures with 10 HD or less who come within 18 meters of the cloud must make a Will save or become panicked for 1d4 rounds, fleeing from the storm.

	\textit{Material Component:} A drop of water mixed with a pinch of dust.
