	This spell functions similarly to \spell{lesser geas}, except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.

	Instead of taking penalties to ability scores (as with \spell{lesser geas}), the subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day it does not attempt to follow the \emph{geas/quest}. Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened. These effects end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the \emph{geas/quest}.

	A \spell{remove curse} spell ends a \emph{geas/quest} spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. The \spell{break enchantment} spell does not end a \emph{geas/quest}, but \spell{limited wish}, \spell{miracle}, and \spell{wish} do.

	Wizards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics and templars call the same spell quest.
