{
	You create a bolt of flame that strikes its target, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).

	This spell can only affect defilers, templars whose sorcerer-kings are defilers, creatures with the defiled template, creatures with the evil subtype, and undead. The bolt strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out.

	A creature killed by this spell has its remains utterly consumed (but not its equipment and possessions). The only way to restore life to a creature that was killed in this way is to use \spell{wish}, \spell{true resurrection}, \psionic{reality revision}, or \spell{miracle}.
