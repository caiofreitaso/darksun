{
	When laying your hand upon a creature, you channel negative energy that deals 1 point of damage.

	Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures such a creature of a like amount of damage, rather than harming it.

	\textit{Heighten Spell:} When you cast it using a spell slot higher, the spell deals an additional 1d8+2 points of damage for each spell slot level above.
