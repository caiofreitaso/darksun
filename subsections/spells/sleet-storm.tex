{
	Driving sleet blocks all sight (even darkvision) within it and causes the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 \skill{Balance} check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the \skill{Balance} skill for details).

	The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.

	\textit{Arcane Material Component:}
	A pinch of dust and a few drops of water.
