{
	A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 1.5 meter. A creature within 1.5 meter has concealment (attacks have a 20\% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50\% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).

	A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

	The spell does not function underwater.
