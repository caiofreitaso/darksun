{
	Also known as the \emph{preserver's scourge}, this spell makes the ground dangerous to defilers. Should a defiler try to tap into land that is protected by a \emph{backlash}, she automatically takes 1d6+1 points of damage for every two caster levels you have (maximum 5d6+5). The defiler must make a \skill{Concentration} check (DC 10 + spell level + damage dealt) in order to continue casting her spell.

	Once it has inflicted damage, the spell is discharged and the ground returns to normal. Only one \emph{backlash} can be cast on any given plot of ground.

	\textit{Material Component:} A thorn.
