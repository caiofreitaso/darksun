    You create a magical calm in the center of the storm, an area safe from powerful winds, rain and sand. You create a pocket of calm in a 9 m radius centered on you. The circle moves with you. Within the circle, the air is calm, and people may converse at a normal volume. Outsider the circle, there may be a raging sand storm or a terrifying Tyr-storm. Like the eye of a hurricane, the area affected by the spell remains unharmed. The storm roars by but has no effect on those within the sheltered eye. \emph{Eye of the storm} does not exclude storms created by spells or the storm-like abilities of creatures.

    \textit{Material Component:} A few grains of sand thrown into the wind.
