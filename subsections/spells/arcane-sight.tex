	This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 36 meters of you. The effect is similar to that of a \spell{detect magic} spell, but \emph{arcane sight} does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.

	You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the \spell{detect magic} spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make \skill{Spellcraft} skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

	If you concentrate on a specific creature within 36 meters of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.

	\emph{Arcane sight} can be made permanent with a \spell{permanency} spell.
