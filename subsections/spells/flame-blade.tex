{
	A 1-meter-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this bladelike beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the \emph{flame blade} are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A \emph{flame blade} can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.

	The spell does not function underwater.
