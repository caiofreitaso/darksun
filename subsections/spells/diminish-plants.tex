	This spell has two versions.

	\textit{Prune Growth}:
	This version causes normal vegetation within long range (120 meters + 12 meters per level) to shrink to about one-third of their normal size, becoming untangled and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and trimmed.

	At your option, the area can be a 30-meter-radius circle, a 45-meter-radius semicircle, or a 60-meter-radius quarter-circle.

	You may also designate portions of the area that are not affected.

	\textit{Stunt Growth}:
	This version targets normal plants within a range of \onehalf mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the following year to one third below normal.

	\emph{Diminish plants} counters \spell{plant growth}.

	This spell has no effect on plant creatures.
