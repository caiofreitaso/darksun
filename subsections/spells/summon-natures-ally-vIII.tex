	This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 8th-level creature, 1d3 7th-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.

	When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
