	You imbue a melee weapon with the powers of your worshipped element. The weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls for the duration of the spell, and an additional special ability depending on your patron element. You are treated as being proficient with the enchanted weapon. Creatures other than you wielding the enchanted weapon do not benefit from the spell. If the weapon is a double-weapon, only one end is affected. At 9th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the enhancement bonus of the armor or shield increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 18th level.
