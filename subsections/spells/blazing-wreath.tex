	Your body is shrouded in flames that damage opponents and protect you. Any creature within 3 meters of you takes 2d8 points of fire damage each round on your turn. Any creature that strikes you with an unarmed attack or with a natural weapon catches on fire. Any nonmagical weapon that strikes you must make a Reflex save or be destroyed.

	The flames grant you damage reduction 15/magic, and immunity to fire. When you move, a blazing wall forms in your wake in each square you pass through. The blazing wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The blazing wall dissipates when the spell ends.

	The \emph{blazing wreath} produces light as a \spell{daylight} spell (bright light in a 18-meter radius, shadowy illumination for an additional 18 meters).
