	This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An \emph{arcane mark} spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

	The spells \spell{see invisibility} and \spell{true seeing}, or the items gem of seeing and robe of eyes likewise allow the user to see an invisible \emph{arcane mark}. A \spell{read magic} spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell.

	If an \emph{arcane mark} is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month.

	\emph{Arcane mark} must be cast on an object prior to casting instant summons on the same object (see that spell description for details).
