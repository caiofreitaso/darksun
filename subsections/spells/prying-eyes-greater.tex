	This spell functions like \spell{prying eyes}, except that the eyes can see all things as they actually are, just as if they had true seeing with a range of 36 meters. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at full normal speed. Also, a greater prying eye's maximum Spot modifier is +25 instead of +15.
