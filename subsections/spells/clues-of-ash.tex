	You receive a smoky vision of the scene before the moment the item was destroyed by touching its ashes. The vision begins from the time the object was destroyed or killed, going backward in time up to 1 min./level. For example, a 7th-level cleric would see the last 7 minutes of the item's existence.

	You can also tell whether the object was destroyed by defiler destruction or not. If vegetation destroyed by defiling is tested, you can make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level) to determine the school of magic cast.
