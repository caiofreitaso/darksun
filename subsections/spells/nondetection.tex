{
	The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as \spell{clairaudience/clairvoyance}, \spell{locate object}, and \emph{detect} spells. \emph{Nondetection} also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast \emph{nondetection}. If you cast \emph{nondetection} on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.

	If cast on a creature, \emph{nondetection} wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.

	\textit{Material Component:}
	A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 cp.
