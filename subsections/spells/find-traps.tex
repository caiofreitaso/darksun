	You gain intuitive insight into the workings of traps. You can use the \skill{Search} skill to detect traps just as a rogue can. In addition, you gain an insight bonus equal to one-half your caster level (maximum +10) on \skill{Search} checks made to find traps while the spell is in effect.

	Note that find traps grants no ability to disable the traps that you may find.
