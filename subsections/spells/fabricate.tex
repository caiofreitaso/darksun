{
	You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the \emph{fabricate} spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 0.03 cubic meter per level instead of 0.3 cubic meter.

	You must make an appropriate \skill{Craft} check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.

	Casting requires 1 round per 0.3 cubic meter (or 0.03 cubic meter) of material to be affected by the spell.

	\textit{Material Component}:
	The original material, which costs the same amount as the raw materials required to craft the item to be created.
