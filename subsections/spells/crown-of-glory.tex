{
	The caster is imbued with an aura of celestial authority, inspiring awe in all lesser creatures.
	
	The caster gains a +4 enhancement bonus to his or her Charisma score for the duration of the spell. All creatures with fewer than 8 HD or levels cease whatever they are doing and are compelled to pay attention to the caster. Any such creature that wants to take hostile action against the caster must make a successful Will save to do so. Any creature that does not make this saving throw the first time it attempts a hostile action is enthralled for the duration of the spell (as the \spell{enthrall} spell), as long as it is in the spell's area, nor will it try to leave the area on its own. Creatures with 8 HD or more may pay attention to the caster, but are not affected by this spell.

	When the caster speaks, all listeners telepathically understand him or her, even if they do not understand the language. While the spell lasts, the caster can make up to three suggestions to creatures of fewer than 8 HD in range, as if using the \spell{mass suggestion} spell (Will save negates); creatures with 8 HD or more aren't affected by this power. Only creatures within range at the time a suggestion is given are subject to it.

	\textit{Material Component:} An opal worth at least 200 cp.
