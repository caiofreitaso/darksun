	This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can be cast on only a single tree at a time; while \emph{liveoak} is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree. The tree on which the spell is cast must be within 3 meters of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 90 meters of something that you wish to guard or protect.

	\emph{Liveoak} must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. The \emph{liveoak} spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant.

	If \emph{liveoak} is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately, wherever it happens to be. If released by you, the tree tries to return to its original location before taking root.
