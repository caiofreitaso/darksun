	All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a \spell{dispel magic} spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever is higher.

	You also have a 1\% chance per caster level of destroying an \spell{antimagic field}. If the \spell{antimagic field} survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined.

	Even artifacts are subject to disjunction, though there is only a 1\% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. (These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even miracle or wish.)

	\textit{Note:} Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95\% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.
