{
	A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 9 meters per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 9 meters to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A \emph{flaming sphere} rolls over barriers less than 1.2 meter tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.

	The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A \emph{flaming sphere} winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

	\textit{Arcane Material Component}:
	A bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron.
