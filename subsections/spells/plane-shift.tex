	You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d\%) from your intended destination.

	\textit{Note:} Plane shift transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back.

	\textit{Focus:}
	A small, forked metal rod. The size and metal type dictates to which plane of existence or alternate dimension the spell sends the affected creatures.
