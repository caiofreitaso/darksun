	You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The \emph{illusory script} appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting are able to read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character, although an illusionist recognizes it as \emph{illusory script}.

	Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the \emph{illusory script} spell was cast. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes. Typical suggestions include ``Close the book and leave,'' ``Forget the existence of the book,'' and so forth. If successfully dispelled by dispel magic, the \emph{illusory script} and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the \spell{true seeing} spell with the \spell{read magic} or \spell{comprehend languages} spell.

	The casting time depends on how long a message you wish to write, but it is always at least 1 minute.

	\textit{Material Component:}
	A lead-based ink (cost of not less than 50 cp).
