	The \emph{knock} spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or arcane locked doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold closures shut). If used to open a \emph{arcane locked} door, the spell does not remove the \spell{arcane lock} but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. \emph{Knock} does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress.
