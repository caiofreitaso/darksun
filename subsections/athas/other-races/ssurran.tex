\subsectionA{Ssurran}
Ssurrans are a race of reptilian humanoids that roam the Tablelands, trading, raiding and hunting that which does not hunt them. Standing up to 1.80 meter tall, they are a hardy species that have adapted to deal with Athas' unforgiving climate. In the region of the Scorched Plateau, their natural resistance to extremes of heat has allowed them to stake their claim over the immediate environs of Lava Gorge, where the majority of other races simply cannot venture. Ruled over by their priests, ssurrans hold ancient beliefs in strange gods and have a reputation for barbarism that is perhaps a little undeserved.

Ssurrans range from 1.20 to 1.80 meter feet in height, weighing anything from 90 to 115 kilograms. They are reptilian, even crocodilian in appearance, with pronounced toothy snouts, scales and a long tail. A ssurran's mouth seems perpetually curved in a slight, sly smile. The ssurran tail is not prehensile and is used for balance, posture and communication.

\subsubsection{Ssurran Society}
The ssurrans are tribal in nature, roaming in groups of related families. At times these groups can dwindle in size, particularly after a lean spell, but tribes have also been known to band together for common purpose, forming vast hordes led by a council of elders from the leaders and shamans of each tribe.

The harsh conditions of life on Athas have driven many ssurrans to live the lives of raiders, taking by force what they cannot gain by other means. The more fortunate and enterprising tribes have turned to trade as a way of life, forging more productive relationships with the other peoples of their region.

Whatever their major pastime, all ssurran tribes are natural scavengers and hunter-gatherers. A typical ssurran is laden down under patchwork armor, assorted bric-a-brac and battered trade goods, and armed with a bizarre assortment of weaponry from across the Tablelands. Ssurrans are hunted for their young by some. Ssurrans raised from the egg can be trained as guards, scouts, and gladiators, and are valued in the city-states of the south. Ssurrans are strict carnivores, and some of their kind are reported to enjoy the flavor of halfling flesh over others.
