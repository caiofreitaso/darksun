\subsectionA{Anakore}
The anakore (or dune freaks) are a race of dim-witted humanoids who live in subterranean colonies, occasionally roaming the surface of Athas to hunt. They have a dorsal ridge running along their spine that allows them to pick up vibrations traveling through the sand. With it, they can detect creatures moving along the sand.

\subsubsection{Anakore Society}
The anakore live within any sandy heap, such as sand dunes or the alluvial fans at the mouths of the canyons. Normally, they travel and hunt in small packs of two to twelve individuals, with the largest, most aggressive acting as leader. They are rarely found outside of sandy areas, but they can walk upright across various kinds of terrain---though they are unusually vulnerable in this state and will avoid fighting at all costs.

The anakore are nomadic burrowers who are constantly moving through the sandy wastes of Athas. It is often possible to identify an area through which anakores have passed by the dead plants found there---the anakores chew the roots away, leaving the upper stalks exposed. In addition to their diet of plant roots, the anakores also eat meat---mekillot, inix, erdlu, elf, dwarf, halfling, and nearly anything except kank.

Anakore speak their own language.
