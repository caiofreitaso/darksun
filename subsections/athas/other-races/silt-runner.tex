\subsectionA{Silt Runner}
Silt runners are a race of short lizard-men with green scales, jagged teeth, and wickedly clawed hands. They are cowardly reptilian humanoids with the curious ability to run across open silt. They have tails, but these usually drag along the ground except when they are running or in combat, when the tail is used to help them maintain their balance. They wear trophies taken from their victims.

\subsubsection{Silt Runner Society}
Most silt runner tribes live on islands of the Silt Sea near the coastline, the same islands that giants live. Giants view them as pests overrunning their homes, and are left alone by silt runners, since they are just too fast to swat properly.

Silt runners live by raiding passing merchant caravans and nearby villages. Silt runners have an unreasoning hatred for elves and attack them on sight---they may even turn aside from a caravan to attack a single elf. They consider the flesh of an elf slain in combat to be the greatest of delicacies.

Silt runners speak a tribal language, and a few of them can
speak Common.
