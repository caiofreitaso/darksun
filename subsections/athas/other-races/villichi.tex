\subsectionA{Villichi}
Villichi are human females who are born with latent psionic powers of great promise. Subtle mutations in mind and body soon set them apart from their biological family, with longer limbs and faces. Villichi are usually cloaked as they are especially susceptible to the burning sun.

Villichi not only mature rapidly, but they are fairly long-lived. The average lifespan of a villichi female is 150 years, although some live even longer. The current high mistress is over 200 years old, and is a psion of great power.

\subsubsection{Villichi Society}
Villichi have formed an extremely close knit community. They never attack one another and only rarely argue with each other. The location of the convent is a closely guarded secret---anyone who inadvertently finds it is usually mindwiped.

The high mistress is always chosen from among villichi who have developed the special power \emph{locate villichi} (see below). By using this power, the high mistress can determine if a villichi child is slain, which usually results in revenge upon the perpetrator. If the perpetrator cannot be located, the revenge is carried out on the entire town, if possible. This is certainly part of the reason why killing a villichi child is considered such a bad omen. Past reprisals have made the killing of a villichi child a very rare thing indeed.
