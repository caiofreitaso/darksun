\subsectionA{Gith}
Gith are a lanky race of reptilian humanoids that, when erect, stand close to 2 meters tall, but who spend most of their time, bent-over in a crouch that makes them appear to be only 1.5 meter tall. Their lower jaws jut forward and, while toothless, they have sharp, bony ridges that they use to crush and grind their food. Their powerful legs allow them to make great leaps, which they use to move about, walking in an awkward waddle only when they cannot jump or when sneaking up on prey.

\subsubsection{Gith Society}
Gith organize themselves into tribes, with the most powerful member acting as leader. All authority comes from the chief, who has the power of life and death over any member of his tribe. If the chief is killed, the strongest members of the tribe will fight to the death in order to determine who will be the new leader. This trial-by-combat occurs immediately, even if the gith tribe is currently in the middle of a battle with another force.

Most gith tribes inhabit mountainous regions, coming down only to raid the villages of other humanoids or to attack a passing caravan. They are usually interested in entertaining themselves with the suffering of others and with the prospect of a good meal (gith will eat anything organic, preferring meat), but know the value of treasure, especially of psionic and magical items.

Gith speak their own language, which has no alphabet but can be expressed in elvish script.
