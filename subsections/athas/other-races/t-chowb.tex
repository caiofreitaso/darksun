\subsectionA{T'Chowb}
T'Chowb are tiny, humanoid creatures with a leathery, gray skin. They have beady, red eyes and a purple ridge along the skull. They are hairless, and their head looks entirely too large for their small body.

These little creatures seek those smarter than themselves to drain their intelligence.

\subsubsection{T'Chowb Society}
A t'chowb is a solitary creature because it doesn't like anyone or anything except the feeling of power it gets from becoming smarter. A sated t'chowb is a genius and uses its newfound intelligence in whatever manner best suits it.

They can be found in cities, on the trail, or almost anywhere that intelligent beings gather.

T'Chowb don't speak any language, except when they drain intelligence.

\subsubsection{T'Chowb Racial Traits}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item $-6$ Strength, +8 Dexterity, $-6$ Intelligence, +2 Charisma: T'Chowbs are quick little creatures who lack intelligence.
    \item Humanoid (t'chowb, psionic): T'Chowb are humanoid creatures with the t'chowb and psionic subtypes.
	\item Tiny: As a Tiny creature, a t'chowb gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class, a +2 bonus on attack rolls, and a +8 bonus on \skill{Hide} checks. He takes a $-8$ size penalty on grapple checks, and his lifting and carrying limits are quadruple those of Medium characters, but he uses bigger weapons than humans use.
    \item T'Chowb occupy a space of 75 centimeters and have a reach of 0 meters.
    \item T'Chowb base land speed is 9 meters.

    \item Racial Hit Dice: A t'chowb begins with two levels of humanoid, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +0, Ref +0, and Will +3.
    \item Racial Skills: A t'chowb's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 5 $\times$ (2 + Int modifier). Its class skills are \skill{Autohypnosis}, \skill{Concentration}, \skill{Hide} and \skill{Move Silently}.
    \item Racial Feats: A t'chowb's humanoid levels give it one feat.

    \item Natural Armor: +1 natural armor bonus to AC.

    \item Intelligence Drain (Su): Intelligent creatures---those with Intelligence score of 3 or higher---hit by a t'chowb's touch attack must succeed on a Will save (DC 11 + t'chowb's Cha. modifier) or start having their intellect drained. The save DC is Charisma-based.\\

    At the start of each turn, the creature loses 1 point of Intelligence and the t'chowb gains 1 point of Intelligence. This draining stops by one of the following conditions:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item The creature is beyond 9 meters of the t'chowb;
        \item The t'chowb reaches an Intelligence score of 24;
        \item The creature Intelligence score becomes lower than 3;
        \item The creature takes any damage;
        \item The t'chowb is successfully psionically attacked---this will also cause the t'chowb to lose all the Intelligence points drained from the creature.
    \end{itemize*}

    This gain in Intelligence lasts for one day.

    \item Enhanced Speed (Su): T'chowbs can use their psionic energy to increase their speed. As swift action, a t'chowb can spend 3 power points to gain +21 meters as enhancement bonus on their land speed until the beginning of their next action.

    \item Psionic Powers: A t'chowb character manifests psionic powers as a 2nd-level psion. If the character takes additional levels of psion, these levels stack with the t'chowb's base manifesting ability for powers known, power points per day, and other effects dependent on manifester level. A t'chowb character likewise uses the sum of its racial spellcasting levels and class levels to determine the abilities of its psicrystal.

    \item Automatic Languages: None. Bonus Languages: Common.
    \item Favored Class: Psion.
    \item Level Adjustment: +1.
\end{itemize*}
