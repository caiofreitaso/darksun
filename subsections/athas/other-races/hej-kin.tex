\subsectionA{Hej-Kin}
Hej-kin are a race of degenerate humanoids that spend their entire lives underground, dwelling in the Athasian underdark near suitable supplies of water. They are omnivores and subsist largely on a diet of small subterranean creatures and plants.

Hej-kin are malevolent creatures that enjoy inflicting pain and fear on those who trespass on their caverns, blaming them for the damage that has been inflicted on the earth by the defilers.

Hej-kin language is a combination of sign and verbal communication, and their voices are low-pitched, resembling human mumbling. Few surface dwellers are able to learn the language. The color of their skin varies from red to light green, but their skin is always thick and very tough. Hej-kin live on average for 40 or 45 years.

\subsubsection{Hej-Kin Society}
Hej-kin do not create artificial tunnels or caves, as they consider the earth to be sacred. They will only occupy naturally-occurring subterranean formations, but they mark these as their property with curious runes on the cave walls.

Hej-kin clans are often led by earth clerics and preservers. Clerics rise highest in hej-kin society and are the only hej-kin who travel to the surface, usually investigating a disturbance that threatens the earth. Hej-kin are never defilers.

Hej-kin are natural enemies to most other surface dwelling and subterranean races, due to the abuse and destruction of the earth perpetrated by these others. Hej-kin clans will migrate to a new area every decade in order to avoid over-using the land on which they dwell.
