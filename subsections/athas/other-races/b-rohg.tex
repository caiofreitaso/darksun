\subsectionA{B'rohg}
B'rohgs are a species of four-armed humanoids akin to giants. Simpleminded, nomadic hunters and gatherers, b'rohgs tend to keep to themselves, only attacking when they feel threatened. Bands have been known to turn to raiding in desperate situations. B'rohgs are often captured and put to work in the arena as gladiators. Some are even tricked into service with promises of food and sweetmeats but this is the exception rather than the rule. Most b'rohgs are not intelligent enough to remember their friends, let alone long-term promises.

Although they are treated like animals by their owners, enslaved b'rohgs still possess enough cunning to be able to escape from time to time. These ``renegade'' b'rohgs often have developed considerable skill with weaponry and combat techniques during their time in captivity and are viewed with concern as a result b'rohgs communicate through a series of grunts and hand signals. Adult b'rohgs stand about 5 meters high.

\subsubsection{B'rohg Society}
Dominated by their strongest males, b'rohgs are a throwback to simpler times. They live in small nomadic bands comprised of 1--4 family units called cliques, consisting of one male, one or two females, and generally fewer than four total offspring. The strongest b'rohg in a band will primarily be hunters, while the older, weaker members and the children are gatherers and water bearers.

B'rohgs have no mastery of fire but do not fear it. They also have no real understanding of death and will ignore objects or creatures that do not display signs of life (although they have learned that ``playing dead'' is a tactic sometimes used by their foes and will repeatedly strike felled enemies, just to be sure).

While they are too stupid to learn more contemporary speech, others can learn the grunt and sign language of the b'rohgs.
