\subsection{Belgoi}
Belgoi are a race of savage humanoids that appear human, but their blue skin, clawed hands and webbed, three-toed feet soon give it away. They have no teeth, no visible ears, and their hair is black and stringy.

\subsubsection{Belgoi Society}
Belgoi live in the most desolate of places, since no other race will allow them nearby. Belgoi seem to revel in destruction, and are considered to be second only to the defilers in the damage they do to the world around them.

Belgoi form large nomadic tribes that move into an area, strip it of all resources, and then move on. These tribes send out raiding parties that attack caravans and small villages, hoping to obtain food and treasure. They will eat anything but prefer the taste of the flesh of intelligent races.

Belgoi speak their own language and the Common tongue.
