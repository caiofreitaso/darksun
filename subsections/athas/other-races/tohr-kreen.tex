\subsectionA{Tohr-Kreen}
Tohr-kreen are larger, cultured versions of thri-kreen. They are more civilized than their smaller cousins, and not nearly as aggressive. However, when they do fight, they are more deadly than the thri-kreen. They are occasionally met travelling about Athas, but none are native to the known lands. Rumors say that they may be from a city located far away, but no tohr-kreen will ever reveal the whereabouts of this city or if it even exists.

A tohr-kreen resembles its smaller cousin and may even be mistaken for one. They resemble a huge praying mantis with the sandy yellow coloring of a mantis warrior. They have dark purple or black eyes and wear a leather harness to carry weapons and other possessions. Tohr-kreen grow to as much as 3 meters high and 4 meters long and weigh from 150 to 200 kilograms. They carry normal weapons and shields, or the special weapon that the thri-kreen have developed, the gythka. They have also developed an improved version of the chatkcha, called a kyorkcha. A tohr-kreen encountered on the road usually has a specially made backpack, filled with art treasures and books it can't part with.

Tohr-kreen speak the language of the thri-kreen, and their own language as well.

% Zik-trin are a race bred by the zik-chil for loyalty and combat prowess. They are not a natural species, but rather are created from tohr-kreen or thri-kreen by the zik-chil in a deeply secretive and complicated ritual. Once the process is complete, the kreen is permanently changed into a zik-trin, and all memories of its former life are gone forever. Zik-trin faithfully serve the Priests of Change, the zik-chil, and obey only their orders. They are not automatons and are capable of thought and even speech (though they rarely choose to speak). It is simply that they are wholly loyal to their creators and live solely to serve them.

% Zik-trin measure several feet taller and longer than the average thri-kreen and weigh proportionately more.

% Zik-trin speak Thri-Kreen, on the rare occasions they choose to do so.

\subsubsection{Tohr-Kreen Society}
Tohr-kreen are known as zik-trin'ta by the kreen. They are covert scouts and secret operatives in service to the Tohr-Kreen Empire. They have been given a high degree of intellectual sophistication by their creators and display philosophical and pacifistic tendencies. This behavior is programmed by the Priests of Change, the zik-chil, who have sent the zik-trin'ta into the Tablelands to act as observers and spies. Often regarded with awe by other kreen, zik-trin'ta are seen as wise and noble philosophers by thri-kreen. This allows the zik-trin'ta to gather much information and exert influence in the interests of the Empire, all in preparation for the plans of their pale priests. Zik-trin'ta often amass lore and artifacts before returning to their homes in the Empire.

\subsubsection{Tohr-Kreen Racial Traits}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item +4 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom: tohr-kreen are more intelligent, relate easier to humanoids, and have higher endurance than their smaller cousins, but they are not as agile.

    \item Large: As a Large creature, a tohr-kreen takes a $-1$ penalty to Armor Class, a $-1$ penalty on attack rolls, and a $-4$ penalty on \skill{Hide} checks.
