\subsectionA{Braxat}
Braxat backs are covered with thick, articulated shells, their heads have a squarish lizard-like shape giving them a reptilian appearance, and the crowns of their heads are defended by three to five horny protrusions. They walk upright on two feet, can speak with a human-like voice, have a fully opposable thumb, and are warm-blooded.

Braxat are true terrors of the desert, usually attacking at night in search of fresh meat. Although they will eat caravan mounts on occasion (with the exception of kanks), they prefer intelligent races.

\subsubsection{Braxat Society}
Braxats are found throughout Athas, wandering the forlorn wastes in search of prey. They are usually solitary creatures, but may rarely be found in mated pairs (in this case, the young are usually safely hidden away in a remote cavern).

Braxat speak their own language.
