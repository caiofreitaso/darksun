\subsection{Former Slave}
A person can become enslaved in one of three ways: by being born enslaved, by being captured during a war or other armed conflict, or by being sold into slavery for committing some crime or failing to pay one's debts.

A former slave can come from two different situations: someone bought their freedom for them, or they escaped. The former almost exclusively happens to nobles and merchants, while the latter is the hardest and most common.

\textbf{Archetype Skill:} \skill{Listen} (Wis).

\subsubsection{Archetype Features}
\textbf{Laborer:} Former slaves gain +2 bonus on a single \skill{Craft} or \skill{Profession} skill.

\textbf{Unspoken Brotherhood:} Former slaves have advantage whenever using \skill{Gather Information} in a slave camp or a slave tribe. In addition, slave tribes offer refuge to former slaves.

\subsubsection{Variant: Craftsman}
The bulk of freemen are craftsmen and artisans who keep their shops within the city walls. Heavily taxed by the king and harassed by the corrupt templars, they are generally ill-contented and suspicious, but too cowardly and intimidated to openly resist their tormenters.

\textbf{Replaces:} You do not gain unspoken brotherhood.

\textbf{Benefit:} Craftsmen can make items at a faster pace than other people. They double their \skill{Craft} check for the purpose of making progress in the creation of an item (either by week or by day).
