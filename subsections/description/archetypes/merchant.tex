\subsection{Merchant}
The Athasian life cannot be without merchants: everything a city-state needs and  cannot produce must pass through their hands. Success comes at a price, however, as they are never truly welcomed by the upper classes for their immense wealth does not come from a great line of noble people, but from the greed and schemes of the freefolk either through honest bargaining or through smuggling banned items.

\textbf{Archetype Skill:} \skill{Diplomacy} (Cha).

\textbf{Bonus Feat:} \feat{Trader}.

\subsubsection{Archetype Feature}
Choose one of the following:

\textbf{Bargainer:} Whenever merchants bargain, the result of this \skill{Diplomacy} opposed check is always one step better for the merchant. In addition, merchants can use caravans of smaller houses to move around the Tablelands.

\textbf{Contrabandist:} Merchants have access to items from the black market. They know where and when to go to buy and sell banned goods, such as spell components or stolen items. In addition, merchants have advantage on \skill{Bluff} and \skill{Disguise} checks related to their contraband.
