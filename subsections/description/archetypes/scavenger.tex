\subsection{Scavenger}
Making a living with scraps found in the wastelands, scavengers roam the desert in search of broken caravans, devastated battlefields, or even poor souls that have become prey of the desert monsters. Scavengers are usually not nomads as most of them have a commensal relationship with raiders, taking what is left of a plunder.

\textbf{Archetype Skill:} \skill{Search} (Int).

\textbf{Bonus Feat:} \feat{Nimble Fingers}.

\subsubsection{Archetype Feature}
\textbf{Salvage:} Scavengers can make a \skill{Search} check to salvage destroyed caravans and vehicles. If the check succeeds, the scavenger earns ceramic pieces by the amount indicated on \tabref{Salvage Vehicle}, either by selling the salvaged parts or using them to offset the cost of other items.

A particular vehicle can be successfully salvaged only once. Any further attempts to salvage the wreckage fail automatically.
