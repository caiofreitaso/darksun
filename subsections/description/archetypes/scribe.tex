\subsection{Scribe}
Merchant houses, templars, and nobles depend on the work of scribes for their livelihood as scribes work as accountants, diplomats, lawyers, and writers. Vital for the Athasian high class, they are kept as valuable items by whoever hired them. Most scribes are slaves for this reason. Enemy houses could make incredible economical damage if they get hold of another house's financial history, and templars would hunt houses tat are financing either the escape of state-owned slaves or the Veiled Alliance.
