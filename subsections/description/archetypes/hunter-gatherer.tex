\subsection{Hunter-Gatherer}
Living the most primitive lifestyle on Athas, hunter-gatherers live in small clans  hunting meat animals and foraging for edible plants. They follow game wherever it leads, with no regard for political boundaries. Their lives are dictated only by their needs, which is why this is also considered the freest lifestyle. If a hunter is not hungry, she does not hunt; if she already has a fine bow, she does not make another.
