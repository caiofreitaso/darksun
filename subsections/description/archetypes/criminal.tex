\subsection{Criminal}
Criminals have spent a lot of time breaking the law and making contacts in the underworld. They are far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and they have survived up to this point by bribing, lying, and hiding.

\textbf{Archetype Skill:} \skill{Appraise} (Int).

\textbf{Bonus Feat:} \feat{Agile}, \feat{Deft Hands}, or \feat{Stealthy}.

% \textbf{Criminal Mind:} Criminals can recognize corrupt templars and guards---and criminals can bribe them whenever they need. In addition, criminals have one trade contact from the criminal underworld (see \hyperref[sec:contacts]{Contacts}).
Choose one of the following:

\textbf{Bribe Official:} Criminals use ceramic pieces to improve an NPC attitude by one step, during a \skill{Diplomacy} check. To determine the amount of ceramic pieces, roll the base bribe described in the table below and multiply it by the \skill{Diplomacy} DC to reach a friendly attitude.

\Table{}{lR||lC}{
  \tableheader NPC Social Class
& \tableheader Base Bribe
& \tableheader NPC Attitude
& \tableheader Multiplier \\
Peasant or slave    &  2d4 cp & Hostile     & $\times$ 35 \\
Freeman or soldier  &  3d8 cp & Unfriendly  & $\times$ 25 \\
Merchant or officer & 5d10 cp & Indifferent & $\times$ 15 \\
Noble or general    & 5d10 $\times$ 10 cp &&\\
% Templar or guard, low-level (1--4) & 12 cp\\
% Templar or guard, mid-level (5--8) & 20 cp\\
% Templar or guard, high-level (9+) & 30 cp
}


\textbf{Criminal Connections:} Criminals have one trade contact from the criminal underworld (see \hyperref[sec:contacts]{Contacts}). They gain one additional contact per point of Charisma bonus as a starting character. These additional contacts don't need to be trade contacts.
