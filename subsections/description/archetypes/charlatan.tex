\subsection{Charlatan}
Selling snake oil, and all other types of scams, charlatans live in the wastelands by fooling people around. This can be cheating in a game, creating scams, or entering people's lives to prey on their weakness. They know what people want to hear, and most of the time it isn't the reality. The charlatan simply speaks their desires.% The wastes are dangerous enough, and charlatans will do anything they can to stay inside the security of the civilization.

\textbf{Archetype Skill:} \skill{Bluff} (Cha).

\textbf{Bonus Feat:} \feat{Deceitful}.

\subsubsection{Archetype Feature}
\textbf{Schemer:} Charlatans can earn money with \skill{Bluff} checks as though using the \skill{Perform} skill. However, this is not a way of entertaining audiences. If a guard's \skill{Sense Motive} check succeeds their \skill{Bluff} check by 11, they see through the scheme and it warrants imprisonment.
