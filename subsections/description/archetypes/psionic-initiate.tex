\subsection{Psionic Initiate}
Initiates are sent to psionic schools throughout the Tablelands to learn and master the Way---the study of the psionic arts. Initiates usually have a strict study routine at their psionic academy, but the routine depends on the school. Some follow the university paradigm (the Cerebran), while others resemble a monastery (the Seer's Dagada), a barracks (the House of the Mind) or even a cult (the Brotherhood of the Mind). No matter the style, in every school only a fraction of the students have any real potential.
