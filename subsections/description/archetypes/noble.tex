\subsection{Noble}
The nobles control the farms and the water of the cities. Usually, each noble family picks a senior member to sit on a parliamentary council. These families sit above the Athasian society with their wealth, power, and privilege. Noble families are expected to defend themselves politically and militarily from the other families, so they live in a closely knit aristocratic society, full of intrigue and backstabbing.
