\subsection{Hermit}
Alone in some forlorn place far away from any permanent society (by their own choice or not) hermits live scattered throughout Athas. Hermits are not usually nomads, since even the most barren patch of land can meet their survival needs. Some choose the isolation to meditate in the psionic arts while others choose to protect a patch of land, but most are isolated because they are outcasts. No matter the reason, hermits tend to act differently because of their isolation---this isolation is what keeps them alive but it also keeps them a bit mad. Be away from society for too long and all social skills degrade over time.

\textbf{Paranoid Loner:} Hermits go to considerable lengths to keep their residences hard to find, as water attracts visitors and other dangers. Hermits have advantage in \skill{Autohypnosis}, \skill{Hide}, and \skill{Listen} checks. However, they have disadvantage in \skill{Bluff}, \skill{Diplomacy}, \skill{Disguise}, \skill{Gather Information}, \skill{Sense Motive} checks.
