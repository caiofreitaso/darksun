\subsection{Bounty Hunter}
Living from quarry to quarry, bounty hunters operate where templars can't: outside their city-state. Usually working as slave catchers or mage hunters, they go to any type of settlements in search of their quarry, from city-states to the tiny slave tribes. While most bounty hunters are paid by the Templarate, some are mercenaries working for the Merchant Houses, while others work even for the Veiled Alliance.
