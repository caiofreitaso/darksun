\subsection{Raider}
Raiders make their living by stealing from caravans, villages, hermits, or even farms surrounding cities. Their villages are isolated enough to increase the costs of sending a force to destroy them. They live by the law of the fittest, choosing their leaders through a hierarchy of violence.

\textbf{Archetype Skill:} \skill{Intimidate} (Cha).

\textbf{Bonus Feat:} \feat{Alertness}.

\subsubsection{Archetype Feature}
\textbf{Bad Reputation:} Raiders are easily recognizable wherever they go, be it for their posture, their facial tattoos, or their behavior. When a raider is in a settlement, they can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report their activity to the authorities.
