\subsection{Herdsman}
Herdsmen live groups of a dozen families wandering the desert from pasture to pasture, pausing only to feed their animals and to drink whatever water is available. Each group tends to about 150 animals (either erdlus or kanks) to survive, so they need to use the land aptly as to not deprive it from grazing plants for their flocks. Traveling in the wilderness, these nomads use their time with any guest to know about the location of the dragon, raiding tribes, and anything else that might be a threat.
