\subsection{Traveler}
Travelers live a nomadic life, but not as herdsmen do: they are urban nomads. Guided by wanderlust, travelers go from settlement to the next experiencing what the people of Athas has to offer---their culture, their food, their customs---wandering the wastelands in search of ever new experiences and stories.

\subsubsection{Archetype Feature}
\textbf{Cultural Chameleon:} Travelers spend much of their lives living among the different races and cultures of Athas, so blending in became one of the best survival tactics for any traveler. After spending a day in a settlement, these people treat the traveler as one of their own.

\textit{Note:} This does not mean that they treat travelers in great regard. Wanderers have the onus and the bonus of being one of the tribe.
