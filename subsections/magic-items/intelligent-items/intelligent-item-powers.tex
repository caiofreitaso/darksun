\subsubsection{Intelligent Item Powers}
Intelligent items are a representation of the state of the psionic character when they created it. As a psionic character, intelligent items have manifester level, a pool of power points per day, and a number of known psionic powers. Intelligent items follow the same rules for manifesting.

\textbf{Manifester Level:} Intelligent items have a manifester level that determines the strength of some effects, like the Difficulty Class for psionic attacks, and its ability to know more powerful psionic powers.

\textbf{Power Points per Day:} To regain used daily power points, intelligent items need the same clear mind as any other manifester.

\textbf{Powers Known:} Intelligent items have a number of known psionic powers. They must fulfill all prerequisites to know a power, including having a key ability score of at least 10 + the power's level.

\textit{Personal Range:} Powers with personal range can target the wielder, if the item desires.

\textit{Key Ability Score:} For the psychometabolism and psychoportation disciplines, intelligent items use their Charisma as the key ability score. They use their Charisma score for power checks, and their Charisma modifier for saving throw DCs.
