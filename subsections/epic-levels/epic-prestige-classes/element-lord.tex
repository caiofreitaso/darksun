\PrestigeClass[\subsectionA][\subsubsection]{Element Lord}
{I am the embodiment of the Fire's fury. Who shall dare to stop me?}
{Ghedran, dwarven fire lord}
{
Some of Athas' most powerful clerics combine their faith with the clearness of mind the Way provides in order to take their worship of the elements to the next step: changing themselves into their patron element. As element lords, they can combine their mastery of the Way and divine power into psionic enchantments that greatly enhance their abilities. Element lords are often called by their elements in order to fight in the Unseen War.

\textbf{Continued Advancement:} When a new element lord level is attained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also attained a level in any one divine spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He gains additional power points per day and access to new powers as if he had also gained a level in any one manifesting class he belonged to previously. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of either class would have gained (bonus metamagic, metapsionic, or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of element lord to the level of whatever other divine spellcasting class and manifesting class the character has, then determines spells per day, caster level, power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.

If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class or more than one manifesting class before he became an element lord, he must decide to which class he adds each level of element lord for purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.

\textbf{Psionic Enchantments:} An element lord can cast psionic enchantments, epic magic that act as 10th-level spells and expends his psionic focus. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time. Each psionic enchantment requires a different preparation time.

To learn, prepare, or cast a psionic enchantment, the element lord must have an Wisdom score equal to at least 20. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an element lord's psionic enchantment is 20 + the element lord's Wisdom modifier.

An element lord can cast only a certain number of psionic enchantments per day. His daily psionic enchantment allotment is given on \tabref{The Element Lord}. Unlike spells, he does not receive bonus psionic enchantments per day.

\textbf{Elemental Shape (Su):} An element lord gains the ability to turn himself into any Small elemental and back again once per day. His options for new forms include all creatures with the elemental type of his patron element. This ability functions like the alternate form special ability, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per element lord level, or until he changes back. Changing form (to elemental or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.

The element lord changes his type and subtype to match his new form. He also gains the special qualities and supernatural special attacks of his new form.

Any gear worn or carried by the element lord melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When the element lord reverts to his true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on his body that they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items worn in the assumed form fall off and land at the element lord's feet.

An element lord can use this ability more times per day at 3rd level and every two levels thereafter (5th, 7th, and 9th level). In addition, he gains the ability to take the shape of a Medium elemental at 3rd level, a Large elemental at 5th level, a Huge elemental at 7th level, and a greater elemental at 9th.

\textbf{Damage Reduction (Ex):} At 2nd level, an element lord gains damage reduction 2/--. This damage reduction rises by 1 point for every new class level.

\textit{Summon Elementals (Sp):} At 4th level, an element lord gains the ability to summon elementals from his patron elemental plane, once per day. This ability functions as the \spell{summon monster VIII} spell, except as noted. The duration of this effect is 1 minute per class level. The element lord can summon 1 greater elemental, 1d3 Huge elementals, or 1d4+1 Large elementals.

The element lord gains one additional use at 6th and 8th level.

\textit{Summon Elder Elementals (Sp):} At 9th level, an element lord gains the ability to summon one elder elemental from his patron elemental plane, once per day. This ability functions as the \spell{summon monster IX} spell, except as noted. The duration of this effect is 10 minutes per class level.

The element lord gains one additional use at 10th level.

\textbf{Elemental Permanence:} At 10th level, an element lord becomes fully attuned to his element. All his hit dice become d8. His type changes to elemental, which brings about the following alterations to her basic nature:
\begin{itemize*}
\item An element lord gains immunity to poison, \spell{sleep} effects, paralysis, and stunning.
\item He is not subject to critical hits or flanking.
\item He does not eat, sleep, or breathe.
\item Unlike other elementals, an element lord retains his dual nature and can be brought back to life via \spell{raise dead}, \spell{reincarnate}, and \spell{resurrection}.
\end{itemize*}

He also gains additional abilities depending on his patron element.

\textit{Air Lord:} An air lord gains flight speed of 42 meters with perfect maneuverability, the air subtype, and the following abilities.

\emph{Air Mastery (Ex):} Airborne creatures take a $-1$ penalty on attack and damage rolls against an air lord.

\emph{Whirlwind (Su):} As an elder air elemental (DC 25 + his Strength modifier).


\textit{Earth Lord:} An earth lord gains the earth subtype, and the following abilities.

\emph{Earth Mastery (Ex):} An earth lord gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both he and his foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, he takes a $-4$ penalty on attack and damage rolls.

\emph{Push (Ex):} An earth lord can start a bull rush maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat modifiers given in Earth Mastery, above, also apply to his opposed Strength checks.


\textit{Fire Lord:} A fire lord doubles his land speed. He gains the fire subtype, and the following abilities.

\emph{Fire Damage (Ex):} Each slam attack deals additional 4d8 points of fire damage.

\emph{Burn (Ex):} As an elder fire elemental (DC 25 + his Constitution modifier).


\textit{Water Lord:} A water lord gains swim speed of 42 meters, the water subtype, and the following abilities.

\emph{Water Mastery (Ex):} A water lord gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both he and his opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the water lord is touching the ground, the water lord takes a $-4$ penalty on attack and damage rolls.

\emph{Vortex (Su):} As an elder water elemental (DC 25 + his Strength modifier).
