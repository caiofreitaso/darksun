\subsectionA{Epic Barbarian}
The epic barbarian becomes a raging leader, not only becoming the very incarnation of rage but inciting rage into his allies. 

\textbf{Hit Die:} d12.

\textbf{Skill Points per Level:} 4 + Int modifier.

\textbf{Incite Rage (Ex):} At 21st level, when an epic barbarian enters a rage, he can incite a barbarian rage in any or all allies within 18 meters. (Any ally who doesn't wish to become enraged is unaffected.) The ally gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a $-2$ penalty to AC, for as long as the epic barbarian remains raging. The rage of affected allies lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier, regardless of whether they remain within 18 meters of you. This is otherwise identical with normal barbarian rage (including the fatigue at its end). This is a mind-affecting ability.

\textbf{Damage Reduction (Ex):} At 22nd level and every two barbarian levels thereafter (24th, 26th, 28th, and 30th level), an epic barbarian improves his damage reduction by 1 point.

\textbf{Bonus Feat:} At 23rd level and every three barbarian levels thereafter (26th, and 29th level), an epic barbarian gains a bonus feat. These bonus feat must be selected from the normal barbarian bonus feat list or the following list of epic feats:
Chaotic Rage,
Damage Reduction,
Fast Healing,
Ruinous Rage,
Terrifying Rage.

\textbf{Rage (Ex):} At 24th and 28th level, an epic barbarian gains one additional use of rage (7/day at 24th, and 8/day at 28th level).

\textbf{Superior Rage (Ex):} At 25th level, an epic barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +10, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +5. The penalty to AC remains at $-2$.

\textbf{Unbreakable Will (Ex):} While in rage, an epic barbarian becomes immune to any enchantment and illusion spells, telepathy powers, and any mind-affecting effects. Against other effects that require Will saves, he gains +8 bonus to resist.
