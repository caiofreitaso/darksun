\subsection{Level-Dependent Benefits}
Level-dependent benefits continue their progression through the epic levels (see \tabref{Level-Dependent Benefits}).

\textbf{Feats:} Every character gains one feat (which may be an epic or nonepic feat at the player's choice) at every level divisible by three. These feats are in addition to any bonus feats granted in the class descriptions.

\textbf{Ability Increases:} Upon gaining any level divisible by four, a character increases one of their ability scores by 1 point. The player chooses which ability score to improve. For multiclass characters, feats and ability increases are gained according to character level, not class level.

\textbf{Class Skill Max Ranks:} The maximum number of ranks a character can have in a class skill is equal to their character level +3.

\textbf{Cross-Class Skill Max Ranks:} For cross-class skills, the maximum number of ranks is one-half the maximum for a class skill.
