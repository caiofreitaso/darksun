\subsection{Psionic Enchantment}
Beyond the horizons of routine magic are whole seas of power that cannot be tapped naturally. The unaided mind, regardless of intelligence, cannot comprehend, let alone command, such tremendous energy. But psionics can ``tune'' the mind for greater mastery of magic. The combination produces the most powerful magic available in a {\tableheader Dark Sun} campaign.

In psionic enchantment, psionics is a means toward an end, a catalyst in the magical process. Spells beyond 9th-level are too difficult for the unaided mind to comprehend. Only through psionic disciplines can the mind handle this magic.

In game terms, psionic enchantments are 10th-level spells that require expending the psionic focus and 50 power points to cast, besides the spell slot of 10th-level. Only certain epic prestige classes grant spell slots at that level: the Athasian dragon, the avangion, the elemental lord, and the spirit initiate.

Specialist wizards do not gain additional spell slots for psionic enchantments---these spell slots do not work with the normal arcane regimes and cannot be manipulated in the same way.
