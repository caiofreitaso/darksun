\subsection{Psionic Enchantment}
Beyond the horizons of routine magic are whole seas of power that cannot be tapped naturally. The unaided mind, regardless of intelligence, cannot comprehend, let alone command, such tremendous energy. But psionics can ``tune'' the mind for greater mastery of magic. The combination produces the most powerful magic available in a {\tableheader Dark Sun} campaign.

In psionic enchantment, psionics is a means toward an end, a catalyst in the magical process. Spells beyond 9th-level are too difficult for the unaided mind to comprehend, so with psionic disciplines a mind can handle magic this powerful.

Only certain epic prestige classes grant spell slots at that level: the Athasian dragon, the avangion, the elemental lord, and the spirit initiate.

\textbf{Sensory Effects:} All psionic enchantments have grand effects, besides all sensory effects. The ground may tremble, rocking tables and tipping over bottles. The weather may temporarily change, clouding over ominously, wind picking up or stopping, temperature growing abnormally hot or chill.

\subsubsection{Casting Psionic Enchantments}
Psionic enchantments follow all spell rules, with additional restrictions. They are 10th-level spells that require expending the psionic focus to cast.

\textbf{Defiling Psionic Enchantments:} The ashen circle left by defiling a psionic enchantment has a radius of 30 meters. All living creatures within this range take 10d6 damage. With a successful Fortitude save, a creature takes half the damage. This is in addition to normal defiling rules. The spellcaster may use raze feats as normal.

\textbf{Specialist Wizards and Psionic Enchantments:} Specialist wizards do not gain additional spell slots for psionic enchantments---these spell slots do not work with the normal arcane regimes and cannot be manipulated in the same way.

\subsubsection{Psionic Enchantment Descriptions}
Psionic enchantments have additional information in their description.

\textbf{Preparation Time:} Spells are prepared each day in a period of 1 hour. Psionic enchantments are more complex, and often more specific. Each psionic enchantment requires a specific amount of time to prepare. The time is measured in days.

\textbf{Cost:} Unlike spells, psionic enchantments have a power points expenditure to cast. This represents the psionic energy required to attune the mind for the arcane power. However, they do not have maintenance costs, as psionic powers do. They are still spells.
