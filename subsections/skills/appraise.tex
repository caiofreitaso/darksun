\Skill{Appraise}{Int}
\textbf{Check:} You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50\% to 150\% (2d6+3 times 10\%,) of its actual value.

Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item's value.

\textit{Appraise Item of Power:} If you know that an item is magical or psionic, you can use Appraise to identify the item's properties. This use requires 25 cp worth of special materials. The DC for appraising magical items is 15 + the caster level of the item, and the DC for psionic items is 10 + the manifester level of the item.
