\Skill{Diplomacy}{Cha}
\textbf{Check:} You can change the attitudes of others (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and the winner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when two advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a third party.

\textit{Influencing NPC Attitudes:} Use the table below to determine the effectiveness of Diplomacy checks (or Charisma checks) made to influence the attitude of a nonplayer character, or wild empathy checks made to influence the attitude of an animal or magical beast.

\textit{Bargaining:} Roll opposed Diplomacy checks between the merchant and the client. Subtract the merchant's result from the client's result, and use the table below to determine the discount (or overcharge) for a given transaction. 

\Table{Bargaining}{CC}{
\tableheader Check Difference & \tableheader Price Modifier\\
50 or higher   & $-90\%$ \\
40 to 49         & $-75\%$ \\
30 to 39         & $-50\%$ \\
20 to 29         & $-40\%$ \\
15 to 19         & $-25\%$ \\
10 to 14         & $-10\%$ \\
5 to 9           & $-5\%$  \\
$-4$ to 4        & $+0\%$  \\
$-9$ to $-5$     & $+5\%$  \\
$-14$ to $-10$   & $+10\%$ \\
$-19$ to $-15$   & $+25\%$ \\
$-29$ to $-20$   & $+40\%$ \\
$-39$ to $-30$   & $+50\%$ \\
$-49$ to $-40$   & $+75\%$ \\
$-50$ or lower & $+90\%$ \\

\textbf{Action:} Changing others' attitudes with Diplomacy generally takes at least 1 full minute (10 consecutive full-round actions). In some situations, this time requirement may greatly increase. A rushed Diplomacy check can be made as a full-round action, but you take a $-10$ penalty on the check.

\textbf{Try Again:} Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial Diplomacy check succeeds, the other character can be persuaded only so far, and a retry may do more harm than good. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly committed to his position, and a retry is futile.

\textbf{Special:} A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks.

If you have the \feat{Negotiator} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in \skill{Bluff}, \skill{Knowledge (nobility and royalty)}, or \skill{Sense Motive}, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in \skill{Appraise}, you get +2 bonus on Bargaining checks.
