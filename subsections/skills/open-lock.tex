\Skill{Open Lock}{dex; trained only}
Attempting an Open Lock check without a set of thieves' tools imposes a $-2$ circumstance penalty on the check, even if a simple tool is employed. If you use masterwork thieves' tools, you gain +2 circumstance bonus on the check.

\textbf{Check:} The DC for opening a lock varies from 20 to 40, depending on the quality of the lock, as given on the table below.

Average lock     & 25\\
Good lock        & 30\\

\textit{Quick Lockpick:} You can try to open a lock more quickly than normal, by increasing the Difficulty Class of the check.

\textbf{Action:} Opening a lock is a full-round action.

\textbf{Untrained:} You cannot pick locks untrained, but you might successfully force them open.
