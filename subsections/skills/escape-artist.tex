\Skill{Escape Artist}{Dex; Armor Check Penalty}
\textbf{Check:} The table below gives the DCs to escape various forms of restraints.

\textit{Ropes:} Your Escape Artist check is opposed by the binder's Use Rope check. Since it's easier to tie someone up than to escape from being tied up, the binder gets a +10 bonus on his or her check.

\textit{Manacles and Masterwork Manacles:} The DC for manacles is set by their construction.

\textit{Tight Space:} The DC noted on the table is for getting through a space where your head fits but your shoulders don't. If the space is long you may need to make multiple checks. You can't get through a space that your head does not fit through.

\textit{Grappler:} You can make an Escape Artist check opposed by your enemy's grapple check to get out of a grapple or out of a pinned condition (so that you're only grappling).

\textbf{Action:} Making an Escape Artist check to escape from rope bindings, manacles, or other restraints (except a grappler) requires 1 minute of work. Escaping from a net or an \spell{animate rope}, \spell{command plants}, \spell{control plants}, or \spell{entangle} spell is a full-round action. Escaping from a grapple or pin is a standard action. Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on how long the space is.

\textbf{Try Again:} Varies. You can make another check after a failed check if you're squeezing your way through a tight space, making multiple checks. If the situation permits, you can make additional checks, or even take 20, as long as you're not being actively opposed.

\textbf{Special:} If you have the \feat{Agile} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2 bonus on \skill{Use Rope} checks to bind someone.

If you have 5 or more ranks in \skill{Use Rope}, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks when escaping from rope bonds.
