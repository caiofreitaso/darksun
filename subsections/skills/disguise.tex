\Skill{Disguise}{cha}
\textbf{Check:} Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others' Spot check results. If you don't draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Spot checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Spot checks.

You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people are making Spot checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can't be sure how good the result is.

The effectiveness of your disguise depends in part on how much you're attempting to change your appearance.

Modifiers for gender, race, and age are cumulative; use any that apply.

Apply modifiers for age per step of difference between your actual age category and your disguised age category. The steps are: young (younger than adulthood), adulthood, middle age, old, and venerable.


If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like get a bonus on their Spot checks according to the table below. Furthermore, they are automatically considered to be suspicious of you, so opposed checks are always called for.

Usually, an individual makes a Spot check to see through your disguise immediately upon meeting you and each hour thereafter. If you casually meet many different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average Spot modifier for the group.

\textit{Conceal Spellcasting:} Spellcasters may attempt to conceal the fact that they are attempting to cast a spell. This is an especially important skill for wizards, who are all-too-frequently the unfortunate target of impromptu lynch mobs. When casting a spell, a spellcaster may attempt to conceal verbal and somatic components by making a Disguise check as a move action, to distract any witnesses. Onlookers may oppose the roll with a \skill{Spellcraft} or \skill{Spot} check.

Attempting to conceal spellcasting if the spellcaster is defiling carries a $-20$ circumstance penalty.

Casting spells in cities with witnesses can be very dangerous. Lynch mobs, templars and even other wizards generally flock to the scene when someone cries \textit{``Wizard!''}.

\textbf{Action:} Creating a disguise requires 1d3 $\times$ 10 minutes of work. Concealing spellcasting requires a move action.

\textbf{Try Again:} Yes. You may try to redo a failed disguise, but once others know that a disguise was attempted, they'll be more suspicious.

\textbf{Special:} A half-elf has +2 racial bonus on Disguise checks made when impersonating elves or humans.

Magic that alters your form, such as \spell{alter self}, \spell{disguise self}, \spell{polymorph}, or \spell{shapechange}, grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks (see the individual spell descriptions). You must succeed on a Disguise check with a +10 bonus to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual using the \spell{veil} spell. Divination magic that allows people to see through illusions (such as \spell{true seeing}) does not penetrate a mundane disguise, but it can negate the magical component of a magically enhanced one.

You must make a Disguise check when you cast a \spell{simulacrum} spell to determine how good the likeness is.

If you have the \feat{Deceitful} feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disguise checks.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in \skill{Bluff}, you get a +2 bonus on Disguise checks when you know that you're being observed and you try to act in character.
