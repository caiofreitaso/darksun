\Skill{Literacy}{none; trained only}

The ability to read has been outlawed for thousands of years by the sorcerer-kings. All characters in a {\tableheader Dark Sun} campaign start without the ability to read or write, and must take ranks in Literacy in order to read anything.

\textbf{Action:} Not applicable.

\textbf{Try Again:} Not applicable. There are no Literacy checks to fail.

The Literacy skill doesn't work like other skills. It works as follows:

\begin{itemize*}
\item You can purchase Literacy just like any other skill, but instead of buying a rank in it, it grants the ability to read and write a single language. Note that the ability to speak the language is not required.
\item You don't make Literacy checks. You either know a language or you don't.
\end{itemize*}
