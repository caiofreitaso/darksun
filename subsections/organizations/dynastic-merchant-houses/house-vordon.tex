\subsection{House Vordon}
\textbf{Location:} Tyr.

\textbf{Banner:} A black diamond on a red-brown field.

\textbf{Trade Goods:} Iron, slaves, artwork, and textiles.

\textbf{Troops:} 2,000 soldiers officially. Over 1,000 more through dummy houses.

Once one of the most feared and respected of Athas's great houses, House Vordon has become something of a laughingstock. This transformation is mainly due to the demented excesses of Tyr's sorcerer-king Kalak. Kalak diverted valuable resources to the construction of a massive ziggurat and all but bankrupted his city.

\subsubsection{Brief History}
House Vordon originated in the ancient city of Kalidnay, strategically located astride the vital trade route between the gold mines of Walis and the hungry markets of Tyr and Gulg. Exactly what caused the fall of this great city is not known today, but the patriarch of House Vordon apparently had some warning of the catastrophe. He and his retainers managed to escape just before the disaster, bearing what wealth they could.

Relocated in Tyr, the house struggled in dire financial straits for years, slowly rebuilding its shattered empire. When iron was discovered in the mountains surrounding Tyr, all of the city's merchants prospered, including Vordon. With increased prosperity came respect. Vordon's offices and outposts sprang up throughout the region. Soon even the hardiest desert raider came to realize that Vordon's caravans and warriors were forces to be reckoned with. Vordon gobbled up numerous smaller houses, even displacing the venerable House Krosi of Urik as the chief carrier of iron and obsidian. By the time sorcerer-king Kalak ascended to the throne, House Vordon was the richest and most influential merchant dynasty in the region.

For a thousand years this situation prevailed and House Vordon grew powerful and arrogant. But in recent years, as Tyr's vast resources were diverted to constructing Kalak's ziggurat, House Vordon's fortunes declined. Trade goods were sold to obtain cash for materials, slaves were requisitioned and set to work on the monument, and the entire city suffered. Soon, Vordon had become an object of derision and ridicule by other houses, who chortled at Kalak's senility and Vordon's troubles.

Vordons are nothing if not pragmatic, however, and the patriarch Thaxos soon joined other Tyr citizens in the conclusion that Kalak should be destroyed. While claiming that his only interest was the welfare of Tyr and her citizens, Thaxos secretly desired to take the throne for himself, elevating himself from simple merchant prince to powerful sorcerer-king. To this end, he began diverting house resources into the creation of several dummy merchant houses secretly controlled by House Vordon. He also started to assemble a secret army, with which he intended to seize power ``in the name of the oppressed people of Tyr.''

\subsubsection{Vordon's Assets}
Financially strapped and on the verge of starvation, Tyr was forced to import vast quantities of food, water, and kank nectar. Vordon helped to provide the city with these items, but a chronic cash shortage within Tyr kept their profits low.
